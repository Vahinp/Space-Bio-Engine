    title: "Microgravity-Induced Changes in Bone Density and Muscle Atrophy in Long-Duration Spaceflight",
    authors: "Smith, J., Johnson, M., Williams, K.",
    year: 2023,
    organism: "Human",
    mission: "ISS",
    environment: "Microgravity",
    summary:
      "Study reveals significant bone density loss (1.5% per month) and muscle atrophy in astronauts during 6-month ISS missions. Resistance exercise protocols showed partial mitigation effects.",
    citations: 42,
    hasOSDR: true,
    hasDOI: true,
    bookmarked: false,
    abstract:
      "Long-duration spaceflight exposes astronauts to microgravity conditions that significantly impact musculoskeletal health. This study examined bone density and muscle mass changes in 24 astronauts during 6-month missions aboard the International Space Station. Using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) and MRI imaging, we quantified changes in bone mineral density and muscle cross-sectional area before, during, and after spaceflight.",
    keyResults: [
      "Bone mineral density decreased by 1.5% per month on average, with greatest losses in weight-bearing bones",
      "Muscle cross-sectional area reduced by 12-17% in lower extremities",
      "Resistance exercise protocols (ARED) reduced bone loss by approximately 40%",
      "Recovery to baseline took 6-12 months post-flight depending on exercise compliance",
    ],
    methods:
      "24 astronauts (12 male, 12 female, ages 35-52) participated in this longitudinal study. DEXA scans were performed at L-180, L-30, R+0, R+30, and R+180 days. MRI imaging of thigh and calf muscles was conducted at the same timepoints. Exercise logs were maintained throughout the mission.",
    conclusions:
      "Microgravity-induced bone and muscle loss remains a significant challenge for long-duration spaceflight. While current countermeasures provide partial protection, additional interventions may be necessary for missions beyond low Earth orbit. Future research should focus on pharmacological adjuncts and optimized exercise protocols.",

    title: "Radiation Effects on Plant Growth and Development in Simulated Martian Conditions",
    authors: "Chen, L., Rodriguez, A., Park, S.",
    year: 2024,
    organism: "Plant",
    mission: "Analog Studies",
    environment: "Radiation",
    summary:
      "Arabidopsis plants exposed to Mars-equivalent radiation showed altered gene expression in DNA repair pathways. Growth rates reduced by 30% compared to controls.",
    citations: 18,
    hasOSDR: true,
    hasDOI: true,
    bookmarked: false,
    abstract:
      "Understanding plant responses to Martian radiation is critical for future life support systems. This study exposed Arabidopsis thaliana to simulated Mars surface radiation levels (0.67 mSv/day) for 60 days in a controlled environment chamber with Mars-analog regolith and atmospheric composition.",
    keyResults: [
      "30% reduction in overall growth rate compared to Earth-normal controls",
      "Upregulation of DNA repair genes (RAD51, BRCA1 homologs) by 2-3 fold",
      "Increased production of antioxidant compounds",
      "Delayed flowering time by approximately 10 days",
    ],
    methods:
      "Arabidopsis seeds were germinated in Mars-analog regolith under 0.6 kPa CO2 atmosphere. Radiation exposure used a Cs-137 source calibrated to Mars surface levels. RNA-seq was performed at 20, 40, and 60 days. Growth parameters were measured weekly.",
    conclusions:
      "Plants demonstrate adaptive responses to Mars-level radiation but with significant growth penalties. Genetic engineering approaches targeting radiation tolerance pathways may be necessary for productive Martian agriculture. Shielding strategies should also be considered for greenhouse designs.",
