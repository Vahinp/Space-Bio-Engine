Cells were Gram-staining-positive, strictly aerobic, non-spore-forming, chemoheterotrophic, and mesophilic rods exhibiting catalase-positive and oxidase-negative reactivity. Strain 1F8SW-P5<sup>T</sup> shared the highest 16S rRNA gene similarity with <i>Microbacterium proteolyticum</i> CECT 8356<sup>T</sup> (99.34%) and the highest <i>gyrB</i> gene similarity with <i>Microbacterium algihabitans</i> KSW2-21<sup>T</sup> (91.34%). Its strongest matches via average nucleotide identity and DNA-DNA hybridization were to <i>Microbacterium hydrothermale</i> CGMCC_1.12512<sup>T</sup> (84.36% and 25.80%, respectively). 1F8SW-P5<sup>T</sup> formed a distinct lineage during phylogenetic and phylogenomic analysis. The biochemical, phenotypic, chemotaxonomic, and phylogenomic features substantiated the affiliation to 1F8SW-P5<sup>T</sup> as a new species of <i>Microbacterium</i>, for which we propose the name <i>Microbacterium mcarthurae</i>, with the type strain 1F8SW-P5<sup>T</sup> (=DSM 115934<sup>T</sup> =NRRL B-65667<sup>T</sup>). Based on metagenomic data collected during the Microbial Tracking mission series, <i>M. mcarthurae</i> was identified from all surfaces (<i>n</i> = 8) over an 8-year period, with an increase in relative abundance over time. This is of potential concern, as we observed resistance to all tested fluoroquinolone antibiotics (<i>n</i> = 6), two β-lactam antibiotics, and one macrolide antibiotic, which was not predicted based on isolate or plasmid genotype alone. Furthermore, we found an increase in virulence, compared to <i>Escherichia coli</i>, when tested within a <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> model. This pathogenic profile highlights the importance of continued characterization of spacecraft-associated microbes, the characterization of previously unidentified antimicrobial resistance and virulence genes, and the implementation of targeted mitigation strategies during spaceflight.<h3>Importance</h3><p>Crew members are at an increased risk for exposure to and infection by pathogenic microbes during spaceflight. Therefore, it is imperative to characterize the species that are able to colonize and persist on spacecraft, how those organisms change in abundance and distribution over time, and their genotypic potential for and phenotypic expression of pathogenic traits (i.e., whether they encode for or exhibit traits associated with antibiotic resistance and/or virulence). Here, we describe a novel species of <i>Microbacterium</i> collected from the crew quarters on the International Space Station (ISS), 1F8SW-P5<sup>T</sup>, for which we propose the name <i>Microbacterium mcarthurae</i>. <i>M. mcarthurae</i> was found to be distributed throughout the ISS with an increase in relative abundance over time. Additionally, this bacterium exhibits a unique antibiotic resistance phenotype that was not predicted from whole-genome sequencing, as well as increased virulence, suggesting the need for the identification of previously undescribed antimicrobial resistance genes and monitoring/mitigation during spaceflight.</p>",html/json-ld,10.1128/msystems.00537-25,

This study examines the nutritional composition of crops grown in space, identifying deficiencies in key nutrients such as calcium and magnesium, along with variable antioxidant profiles. These imbalances may impact astronaut physiology, particularly bone health and immune function, and are potentially linked to altered gene expression pathways in microgravity. Emerging evidence also suggests increased intestinal permeability, referred as leaky gut syndrome, which further disrupts nutrient absorption and immune regulation. To mitigate these issues, we evaluate targeted strategies including bioengineering of nutrient-dense crops, incorporation of antioxidant-rich species, and personalized nutrition guided by pharmacogenomics. Approaches such as biofortification and tailored supplementation are proposed to address these challenges. This work contributes to the development of resilient space agriculture systems that support astronaut health during deep space missions and future planetary habitation.",html/json-ld,10.1038/s41526-025-00490-z,

Current invasive ICP measurement techniques are unsuitable for austere environments like spaceflight. In this study, we explore the potential of plasma-derived cell-free RNA (cfRNA) biomarkers as non-invasive alternatives to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers for ICP assessment. We conducted a secondary analysis of NASA's Open Science Data Repository datasets 363–364, focusing on plasma and CSF biomarkers related to ICP and neurovascular health. An ensemble model combining Support Vector Machine, Gradient Boosting Regressor, and Ridge Regression was developed to capture plasma-CSF biomarker relationships. To address limited sample size, we employed a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate synthetic plasma-CSF biomarker pairs, expanding the dataset from 29 to 279 samples. The model's performance was evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and validated against real biomarker data. The GAN-augmented ensemble model achieved high predictive accuracy with an MSE of 0.0044. Synthetic plasma-CSF pairs closely aligned with actual biomarker distributions, demonstrating their effectiveness in reducing overfitting and enhancing model robustness. Strong correlations between plasma-derived RNA biomarkers and corresponding CSF indicators support their potential as non-invasive proxies for ICP assessment. This study establishes a novel framework for non-invasive ICP monitoring using plasma cfRNA profiles enriched with GAN-generated synthetic data.

The NASA Open Science Data Repository (OSDR; https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/ ) serves as a valuable resource, housing data derived from model organisms and human experiments conducted in spaceflight and terrestrial microgravity analogues. Machine Learning applications could maximize the use of existing data to understand and ultimately counteract physiological abnormalities during long-term missions. In our present study, we identified enriched terms and pathways associated with significantly dysregulated genes within each species and across orthologous counterparts. We also generated AI-ready merged meta-datasets comprised of musculoskeletal tissues from Mus musculus and Homo sapiens organisms. We then applied a series of supervised Machine Learning models to classify genes that were significantly over-expressed and under-expressed. Subsequently, we explored the utility of Transfer Learning in this domain by pretraining a model on the larger Mus musculus merged dataset and then refining it on the smaller Homo sapiens dataset. This approach showcases the potential of Transfer Learning in providing an insight into the effective transfer of information from model organisms to humans, offering a robust framework for advancing research in space biology and developing countermeasures for long-duration space exploration.",crossref,10.2478/gsr-2025-0003,

These environmental factors can lead to cellular damage, inflammation, and a range of health complications, including cardiovascular problems, immune system impairment, and an increased risk of cancer. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) is a critical transcription factor that regulates the body's defense mechanisms against oxidative stress by promoting the expression of antioxidant enzymes. Recent research has shed more light on the critical role of NRF2 in addressing space-related health challenges. In this study, we developed a computational methodology to explore the plasticity of the gene expression profile in flight and postflight conditions, highlighting the genes and corresponding mechanisms that do not return to ground levels and correlate with gene signatures associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD). RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data from human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) have been used to investigate the cellular effects of microgravity on cardiac function. Gene expression monotonicity studies were performed and linked to genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to highlight the monotonically expressed genes associated with CVD. The selected monotonically expressed genes were also mapped onto the NRF2 network to investigate the impact of spaceflight on human cardiomyocyte function in the context of redox signaling pathways. Based on this knowledge, we used computational drug repurposing methods to suggest a short list of repurposed drug candidates that can be further tested in astronauts for the prevention of CVD. This study provides insights into the molecular and redox signaling alterations in cardiomyocytes induced by spaceflight, laying the foundation for future research aimed at mitigating cardiovascular risks in astronauts and advancing clinical applications on Earth.",html/json-ld,10.1002/pmic.202400241,

Transcriptomic changes have been observed in tissues during spaceflight, including the kidney. We analysed kidney transcriptome patterns in two different strains of mice flown on the International Space Station, C57BL/6J and BALB/c. Here we show a link between spaceflight and transcriptome patterns associated with dysregulation of lipid and extracellular matrix metabolism and altered transforming growth factor-beta signalling. A stronger response was seen in C57BL/6J mice than BALB/c. Genetic differences in hyaluronan metabolism between strains may confer protection against extracellular matrix remodelling through the downregulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition.

In this study, we aimed to determine the levels of inflammasome activation in the brains of mice that were housed in the International Space Station (ISS) for 37 days. C57BL/6 mice were launched to the ISS as part of NASA's Rodent Research 1 Mission on SpaceX-4 CRS-4 Dragon cargo spacecraft from 21 September 2014 to 25 October 2014. Dissected mouse brains from that mission were analyzed by immunoblotting of inflammasome signaling proteins and Electrochemiluminescence Immunoassay (ECLIA) for inflammatory cytokine levels. Our data indicate decreased inflammasome activation in the brains of mice that were housed in the ISS for 37 days when compared to the brains of mice that were maintained on the ground, and in mice corresponding to the baseline group that were sacrificed at the time of launching of SpaceX-4. Moreover, we did not detect any significant changes in the expression levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-2, IFN-γ, IL-5, IL-6, IL-12p70 and IL-10 between the ground control and the flight groups. Together, these studies suggest that spaceflight results in a decrease in the levels of innate immune signaling molecules that govern inflammasome signaling in the brain of mice.",html/json-ld,10.3390/cells14060417,

For example, liver dysfunction is a common phenotype observed in space-flown rodents, and this dysfunction is partially reflected in transcriptomic changes. Studies linking transcriptomics with liver dysfunction rely on tools which exploit correlation, but these tools make no attempt to disambiguate true correlations from spurious ones. In this work, we use a machine learning ensemble of causal inference methods called the Causal Research and Inference Search Platform (CRISP) which was developed to predict causal features of a binary response variable from high-dimensional input. We used CRISP to identify genes robustly correlated with a lipid density phenotype using transcriptomic and histological data from the NASA Open Science Data Repository (OSDR).

Most existing machine learning (ML) algorithms fail in high-dimensional settings where many features could be redundant. A critical process of feature selection is thus applied in such a setting that helps in identifying the most relevant features while removing redundant ones. With the increase in high dimensionality, one is also faced with problems of efficiency and interpretation in performing such selection methods. Therefore, this paper proposes a “novel” feature selection framework that uses an ensemble of interpretable ML algorithms to perform feature selection and the ranking of final features.

Research into mitigating these health issues includes analysis of the transcriptome of rodents sent to the International Space Station. This project investigates the effects of spaceflight on the gene expression of mammary tissue of female mice of two age groups, 10-12 and 32 weeks, in order to assess the impact of age and spaceflight on gene expression. Spaceflight-induced changes to gene expression in rodent mammary tissue could contribute to the characterization of the impact of spaceflight on female astronaut health, which has been historically underserved. Analysis of the OSD-511 dataset from NASA’s Open Science Data Repository utilized a containerized implementation of their RNA-Seq pipeline on the San José State University High Performance Computing Cluster. Seven genes were found to be differentially expressed across all comparison groups; one gene, Greb1, is implicated in hormone mediated disease.

While extensive research exists on the impacts of spaceflight, there is a gap regarding female reproductive risks. We hypothesize that space stressors could have enduring effects on female health, potentially increasing risks for future pregnancies upon return to Earth, particularly related to small-for-gestational-age (SGA) fetuses. To address this, we identify a shared microRNA (miRNA) signature between SGA and the space environment, conserved across humans and mice. These miRNAs target genes and pathways relevant to diseases and development. Employing a machine learning approach, we identify potential FDA-approved drugs to mitigate these risks, including estrogen and progesterone receptor antagonists, vitamin D receptor antagonists, and DNA polymerase inhibitors. This study underscores potential pregnancy-related health risks for female astronauts and proposes pharmaceutical interventions to counteract the impact of space travel on female health. A circulating miRNA signature linked to birth defect risk, (i.e. as small-for-gestational-age (SGA) fetuses), was identified for females exposed to the space environment.

Previous radiation data are from the International Space Station and the Space Shuttle in low-Earth orbit protected by heavy shielding and Earth’s magnetic field7,8 and lightly shielded interplanetary robotic probes such as Mars Science Laboratory and Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter9,10. Limited data from the Apollo missions11–13 and ground measurements with substantial caveats are also available14. Here we report radiation measurements from the heavily shielded Orion spacecraft on the uncrewed Artemis I lunar mission. At differing shielding locations inside the vehicle, a fourfold difference in dose rates was observed during proton-belt passes that are similar to large, reference solar-particle events. Interplanetary cosmic-ray dose equivalent rates in Orion were as much as 60% lower than previous observations9. Furthermore, a change in orientation of the spacecraft during the proton-belt transit resulted in a reduction of radiation dose rates of around 50%. These measurements validate the Orion for future crewed exploration and inform future human spaceflight mission design.

Therefore, understanding the response of plants to spaceflight is essential for improving the selection and engineering of plants and spaceflight conditions. In particular, understanding the root-tip's response to spaceflight is of importance as it is the center of orchestrating the development of the root, the primary organ for the absorption of nutrients and anchorage. GLDS-120 is a pioneering study by Paul et al. that used transcriptomics to evaluate the spaceflight response of the root-tip of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana in dark and light through separate analyses of three genotype groups (Wassilewskija, Columbia-0, and Columbia-0 PhyD) and comparison of genotype responses. Here, we provide a complementary analysis of this dataset through a combined analysis of all samples while controlling for the genotypes in a paired analysis. We identified a robust transcriptional response to spaceflight with 622 DEGs in light and 200 DEGs in dark conditions. Gene enrichment analysis identified 37 and 13 significantly enriched terms from biological processes in light and dark conditions, respectively. Prominent enrichment for hypoxia-related terms in both conditions suggests hypoxia is a key stressor for root development during spaceflight. Additional enriched terms in light conditions include the circadian cycle, light response, and terms for the metabolism of flavonoid and indole-containing compounds.

Metagenomics revealed significant changes in 44 microbiome species, including relative reductions in bile acid and butyrate metabolising bacteria like Extibacter muris and Dysosmobacter welbionis. Functional prediction indicate over-representation of fatty acid and bile acid metabolism, extracellular matrix interactions, and antibiotic resistance genes. Host gene expression described corresponding changes to bile acid and energy metabolism, and immune suppression.

Remarkably, these changes bear similarities to those observed during the aging process on Earth. However, our understanding of the connection between these molecular shifts and disease development in space remains limited. Frailty syndrome, a clinical syndrome associated with biological aging, has not been comprehensively investigated during spaceflight. To bridge this knowledge gap, we leveraged murine data obtained from NASA’s GeneLab, along with astronaut data gathered from the JAXA and Inspiration4 missions. Our objective was to assess the presence of biological markers and pathways related to frailty, aging, and sarcopenia within the spaceflight context. Through our analysis, we identified notable changes in gene expression patterns that may be indicative of the development of a frailty-like condition during space missions.

While &gt;93% of differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) in vesicles and metabolites recovered within six months, the majority (73%) of plasma DAPs were still perturbed post-flight. Moreover, these proteomic alterations correlated better with peripheral blood mononuclear cells than whole blood, suggesting that immune cells contribute more DAPs than erythrocytes. Finally, to discern possible mechanisms leading to brain-enriched protein detection and blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, we examined protein changes in dissected brains of spaceflight mice, which showed increases in PECAM-1, a marker of BBB integrity. These data highlight how even short-duration spaceflight can disrupt human and murine physiology and identify spaceflight biomarkers that can guide countermeasure development. Here the authors report spaceflight secretome profiles by integrating plasma proteome, metabolome, and extracellular vesicles/particles proteome from the SpaceX Inspiration4 crew, which showed differences in coagulation, oxidative stress, and brain-enriched proteins.",html/json-ld,10.1038/s41467-024-48841-w,

Here, using single-cell analysis of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)&nbsp;exposed to short term (25 hours) simulated microgravity, we characterize altered genes and pathways at basal and stimulated states with a Toll-like Receptor-7/8 agonist. We validate single-cell analysis by RNA sequencing and super-resolution microscopy, and against data from the Inspiration-4 (I4) mission, JAXA (Cell-Free Epigenome) mission, Twins study, and spleens from mice on the International Space Station. Overall, microgravity alters specific pathways for optimal immunity, including the cytoskeleton, interferon signaling, pyroptosis, temperature-shock, innate inflammation (e.g., Coronavirus pathogenesis pathway and IL-6 signaling), nuclear receptors, and sirtuin signaling. Microgravity directs monocyte inflammatory parameters, and impairs T cell and NK cell functionality. Using machine learning, we identify numerous compounds linking microgravity to immune cell transcription, and demonstrate that the flavonol, quercetin, can reverse most abnormal pathways. These results define immune cell alterations in microgravity, and provide opportunities for countermeasures to maintain normal immunity in space. The phenotype and function of immune cells could change during spaceflight. Here the authors use simulated microgravity, coupled to validation with spaceflight data, to assess whether there are distinct gene expression changes in resting and TLR 7/8 stimulated PBMCs and found conserved changes in IFN signalling, the cytoskeleton, IL-6 and sirtuin signalling.",html/json-ld,10.1038/s41467-023-42013-y,

To better characterize this effect, we generated single-cell, multi-ome, cell-free RNA (cfRNA), biochemical, and hematology data for the SpaceX Inspiration4 (I4) mission crew. We found that 18 cytokines/chemokines related to inflammation, aging, and muscle homeostasis changed after spaceflight. In I4 single-cell multi-omics data, we identified a “spaceflight signature”&nbsp;of gene expression characterized by enrichment in oxidative phosphorylation, UV response, immune function, and TCF21 pathways. We confirmed the presence of this signature in independent datasets, including the NASA Twins Study, the I4 skin spatial transcriptomics, and 817 NASA GeneLab mouse transcriptomes. Finally, we observed that (1) T cells showed an up-regulation of FOXP3, (2) MHC class I genes exhibited long-term suppression, and (3) infection-related immune pathways were associated with microbiome shifts. In summary, this study reveals conserved and distinct immune disruptions occurring and details a roadmap for potential countermeasures to preserve astronaut health. Multiple omics platforms and deep single-cell profiling in the I4 astronauts reveal both conserved and distinct immune system disruptions across missions, provide a single-cell immune reference for future missions.",html/json-ld,10.1038/s41467-024-49211-2,

Here, we expand on this work to determine the biological factors rescued by the countermeasure treatment. We performed RNA-sequencing and transcriptomic analysis on 3D microvessel cell cultures exposed to simulated deep space radiation (0.5 Gy of Galactic Cosmic Radiation) with and without the antagonists to three microRNAs: miR-16-5p, miR-125b-5p, and let-7a-5p (i.e., antagomirs). Significant reduction of inflammation and DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) activity and rescue of mitochondria functions are observed after antagomir treatment. Using data from astronaut participants in the NASA Twin Study, Inspiration4, and JAXA missions, we reveal the genes and pathways implicated in the action of these antagomirs are altered in humans. Our findings indicate a countermeasure strategy that can potentially be utilized by astronauts in spaceflight missions to mitigate space radiation damage. In space radiation-exposed cells, targeting specific microRNAs with antagomirs can reduce cardiovascular damage and improve cellular function.

Here, we extend molecular work to energy metabolism and sex hormone signaling in mice and humans. We found spaceflight induced changes in insulin and estrogen signaling in rodents and humans. Murine changes were most prominent in the liver, where we observed inhibition of insulin and estrogen receptor signaling with concomitant hepatic insulin resistance and steatosis. Based on the metabolic demand, metabolic pathways mediated by insulin and estrogen vary among muscles, specifically between the soleus and extensor digitorum longus. In humans, spaceflight induced changes in insulin and estrogen related genes and pathways. Pathway analysis demonstrated spaceflight induced changes in insulin resistance, estrogen signaling, stress response, and viral infection. These data strongly suggest the need for further research on the metabolic and reproductive endocrinologic effects of space travel, if we are to become a successful interplanetary species.

In this study, we employed an innovative approach by integrating single-cell multiomics (transcriptomics and chromatin accessibility) with spatial transcriptomics to elucidate the impact of spaceflight on the mouse brain in female mice. Our comparative analysis between ground control and spaceflight-exposed animals revealed significant alterations in essential brain processes including neurogenesis, synaptogenesis and synaptic transmission, particularly affecting the cortex, hippocampus, striatum and neuroendocrine structures. Additionally, we observed astrocyte activation and signs of immune dysfunction. At the pathway level, some spaceflight-induced changes in the brain exhibit similarities with neurodegenerative disorders, marked by oxidative stress and protein misfolding. Our integrated spatial multiomics approach serves as a stepping stone towards understanding spaceflight-induced CNS impairments at the level of individual brain regions and cell types, and provides a basis for comparison in future spaceflight studies.

This includes the activation of genes associated with blood homeostasis and erythropoiesis, with a particular emphasis on those involved in globin chain production. Haemoglobin biology provides an intriguing model for studying space omics, as it has been extensively explored at multiple -omic levels, spanning DNA, RNA, and protein analyses, in both experimental and clinical contexts. In this study, we examined the developmental expression of haemoglobin over time and space using a unique suite of multi-omic datasets available on NASA GeneLab, from the NASA Twins Study, the JAXA CFE study, and the Inspiration4 mission. Our findings reveal significant variations in globin gene expression corresponding to the distinct spatiotemporal characteristics of the collected samples. This study sheds light on the dynamic nature of globin gene regulation in response to the space environment and provides valuable insights into the broader implications of space omics research.

The biology driving the frequency of skin issues in astronauts is currently not well understood. To address this issue, we used a systems biology approach utilizing NASA’s Open Science Data Repository (OSDR) on space flown murine transcriptomic datasets focused on the skin, biochemical profiles of 50 NASA astronauts and human transcriptomic datasets generated from blood and hair samples of JAXA astronauts, as well as blood samples obtained from the NASA Twins Study, and skin and blood samples from the first civilian commercial mission, Inspiration4. Key biological changes related to skin health, DNA damage &amp; repair, and mitochondrial dysregulation are identified as potential drivers for skin health risks during spaceflight. Additionally, a machine learning model is utilized to determine gene pairings associated with spaceflight response in the skin. While we identified spaceflight-induced dysregulation, such as alterations in genes associated with skin barrier function and collagen formation, our results also highlight the remarkable ability for organisms to re-adapt back to Earth via post-flight re-tuning of gene expression. Our findings can guide future research on developing countermeasures for mitigating spaceflight-associated skin damage. Spaceflight is a hostile environment which can lead to health problems in astronauts, including in the skin. It is not currently well understood why these skin problems occur. Here, we analyzed data from the skin of space flown mice and astronauts to try and identify possible explanations for these skin problems. It appears that changes in the activation of genes related to damage to DNA, skin barrier health, and mitochondria (the energy-producing parts of cells) may play a role in these skin problems. Further research will be needed to confirm exactly how these changes influence skin health, which could lead to solutions for preventing&nbsp;and managing such issues in astronauts. Cope, Elsborg et al. analyzed transcriptomic data from mice and astronauts flown to space and identified molecular signatures of DNA damage and repair, mitochondrial dysregulation, and skin barrier disruption.

The goal of this project is to quantitatively synthesize the data on the effects of actual or simulated microgravity on the cardiovascular system. In collaboration with the Ames Life Science Data Archive (ALSDA) Analysis Working Group we developed a list of relevant cardiovascular search terms, based on which medical librarians generated the search strategy in Medline, CINAHL, Embase, and NASA repositories, yielding 18,837 articles. In parallel, we recruited ~100 young professionals through space industry&ndash;affiliated organizations. These individuals completed a virtual training course on the nature and methodologies of the project. They initially screened at a rate of 5,000 articles/month; however, individualized training from project supervisors increased this rate to 60,000 articles/month. Following title/abstract screening, 3,539 included articles were labelled and grouped according to population (human, rodent) and experimental methods (simulated microgravity, actual spaceflight) for full-text screening. Full-text screening of ~900 articles in a humans and actual microgravity subgroup is currently underway, with 200 articles now completed. We anticipate that teams will be extracting and curating and submitting data into the new ALSDA submission portal and repository.

This experiment used Biological Research in Canisters-Petri Dish Fixation Units (BRIC-PDFUs) to grow asynchronous ground control and spaceflight cultures of S. aureus for 48 h. RNAIII, the effector of the Accessory Gene Regulator (Agr) quorum sensing system, was the most highly upregulated gene transcript in spaceflight relative to ground controls. The agr operon gene transcripts were also highly upregulated during spaceflight, followed by genes encoding phenol-soluble modulins and secreted proteases, which are positively regulated by Agr. Upregulated spaceflight genes/proteins also had functions related to urease activity, type VII-like Ess secretion, and copper transport. We also performed secretome analysis of BRIC-23 culture supernatants, which revealed that spaceflight samples had increased abundance of secreted virulence factors, including Agr-regulated proteases (SspA, SspB), staphylococcal nuclease (Nuc), and EsxA (secreted by the Ess system). These data also indicated that S. aureus metabolism is altered in spaceflight conditions relative to the ground controls.

Next, we validated our results using gene expression data of mice irradiated with simulated GCR and JAXA astronauts. We showed that primarily <sup>56</sup>Fe induces a persistent DNA methylation increase whereas <sup>28</sup>Si and X-ray induce a decrease DNA methylation which is not persistent with time. Moreover, we highlighted the role of nuclear chromatin architecture in cell response to external radiation.

The environmental conditions in space (e.g., microgravity and radiation) cause harmful effects similar to those seen during aging. As the mechanistic pathways underlying accelerated aging in spaceflight are not fully understood, the identification of critical targets for promoting longevity in spaceflight remains challenging. We analyzed genomics data from the GLDS-207 project to identify potential targets related to longevity. Analysis of RNA-seq data from four Drosophila variants using the GeneLab Galaxy platform indicated that spaceflight significantly affected differential gene expression in the heads of flies, specifically in the seizure (sei) mutant, which alters the voltage gated potassium channels in the cell membrane. Spaceflight induced a significant decrease in the expression of the retinal degeneration A gene (rdgA) in mutant flies that survived the 30-day space mission. This gene encodes for the protein diacylglycerol kinase (DGK), which modulates the activation of the mechanistic target of the rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway, known to negatively regulate aging. Therefore, DGK may be a potential target for promoting longevity in space conditions. Further investigation of the effects of decreased rdgA expression on the lifespan of other organisms under spaceflight conditions will clarify the role of DGK in promoting longevity.",http_last_modified,10.2478/gsr-2024-0002,

This water will be used to irrigate future spaceflight crop production systems. We have evaluated the impact of three concentrations (31 ppb, 125 ppb, and 500 ppb) of ionic silver biocide solutions on lettuce in an arcillite (calcinated clay particle substrate) and hydroponic (substrate-less) growth setup after 28 days. Lettuce plant growth was reduced in the hydroponic samples treated with 31 ppb silver and severely stunted for samples treated at 125 ppb and 500 ppb silver. No growth defects were observed in arcillite-grown lettuce. Silver was detectable in the hydroponic-grown lettuce leaves at each concentration but was not detected in the arcillite-grown lettuce leaves. Specifically, when 125 ppb silver water was applied to a hydroponics tray, Ag<sup>+</sup> was detected at an average amount of 7 μg/g (dry weight) in lettuce leaves. The increase in Ag<sup>+</sup> corresponded with a decrease in several essential elements in the lettuce tissue (Ca, K, P, S). In the arcillite growth setup, silver did not impact the plant root zone microbiome in terms of alpha diversity and relative abundance between treatments and control. However, with increasing silver concentration, the alpha diversity increased in lettuce root samples and in the water from the hydroponics tray samples. The genera in the hydroponic root and water samples were similar across the silver concentrations but displayed different relative abundances. This suggests that ionic silver was acting as a selective pressure for the microbes that colonize the hydroponic water. The surviving microbes likely utilized exudates from the stunted plant roots as a carbon source. Analysis of the root-associated microbiomes in response to silver showed enrichment of metagenomic pathways associated with alternate carbon source utilization, fatty-acid synthesis, and the ppGpp (guanosine 3'-diphosphate 5'-diphosphate) stringent response global regulatory system that operates under conditions of environmental stress. Nutrient solutions containing Ag<sup>+</sup> in concentrations greater than 31 ppb in hydroponic systems lacking cation-exchange capacity can severely impact crop production due to stunting of plant growth.",html/json-ld,10.3390/microorganisms12030515,

Specifically, an individual SSN was established for each sample. Based on the topological structures of 591 SSNs, the differentially interacted genes (DIGs) were identified between spaceflights and ground controls. The results showed that spaceflight disrupted the gene interaction patterns in mice and resulted in significant enrichment of biological processes such as protein/amino acid metabolism and nucleic acid (DNA/RNA) metabolism (P-value &lt; 0.05).

Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to identify library preparation method and mission as the primary sources of batch effect among the technical variables in the combined dataset. We next quantitatively evaluated the ability of each of the indicated methods to correct for each identified technical batch variable using the following criteria: BatchQC, PCA, dispersion separability criterion, log fold change correlation, and differential gene expression analysis.

Unfortunately, the microgravity of space can cause stress in plants, which can reduce growth. The Random Positioning Machine, RPM, is a device designed to provide an analogue for the effects of microgravity on Earth by rotating specimens in three dimensions. In this study, we compare the results from experiments conducted on the International Space Station with those conducted using the RPM (in the 3D clinostat mode) on the ground. Seedlings of Arabidopsis thaliana wildtype and phytochrome mutants were grown in true microgravity and in the omnidirectional gravity on a rotating RPM on the ground. We found that the RPM treatment caused less stress in the seedlings than did true microgravity. We also report that phytochromes A and B play roles in phototropic responses to unilateral light and that these roles differ in the two gravitational environments. Finally, we conclude that while root phototropism in unilateral red and blue differs significantly between the microgravity and omnidirectional stimuli, the RPM can serve as a reasonable analogue of microgravity conditions for assessment of shoot phototropism.",html/json-ld,10.1007/s12217-023-10066-9,

One such concern is muscle atrophy, which is partly attributed to the dysregulation of calcium levels due to abnormalities in SERCA pump functioning. To identify potential biomarkers for this condition, multi-omics data and physiological data available on the NASA Open Science Data Repository (osdr.nasa.gov) were used, and machine learning methods were employed. Specifically, we used multi-omics (transcriptomic, proteomic, and DNA methylation) data and calcium reuptake data collected from C57BL/6 J mouse soleus and tibialis anterior tissues during several 30+ day-long missions on the international space station. The QLattice symbolic regression algorithm was introduced to generate highly explainable models that predict either experimental conditions or calcium reuptake levels based on multi-omics features. The list of candidate models established by QLattice was used to identify key features contributing to the predictive capability of these models, with Acyp1 and Rps7 proteins found to be the most predictive biomarkers related to the resilience of the tibialis anterior muscle in space. These findings could serve as targets for future interventions aiming to reduce the extent of muscle atrophy during space travel.",html/json-ld,10.1038/s41526-023-00337-5,

Hibernation confers radio-protective effects in hibernating animals, and this has led to the investigation of synthetic torpor to mitigate the deleterious effects of chronic low-dose-rate radiation exposure. Here we describe an induced torpor model we developed using the zebrafish. We explored the effects of radiation exposure on this model with a focus on the liver. Transcriptomic and behavioural analyses were performed. Radiation exposure resulted in transcriptomic perturbations in lipid metabolism and absorption, wound healing, immune response, and fibrogenic pathways. Induced torpor reduced metabolism and increased pro-survival, anti-apoptotic, and DNA repair pathways. Coupled with radiation exposure, induced torpor led to a stress response but also revealed maintenance of DNA repair mechanisms, pro-survival and anti-apoptotic signals. To further characterise our model of induced torpor, the zebrafish model was compared with hepatic transcriptomic data from hibernating grizzly bears (Ursus arctos horribilis) and active controls revealing conserved responses in gene expression associated with anti-apoptotic processes, DNA damage repair, cell survival, proliferation, and antioxidant response. Similarly, the radiation group was compared with space-flown mice revealing shared changes in lipid metabolism.",html/json-ld,10.1038/s41598-022-26976-4,

While plants represent an essential component of future long-duration space travel, the impacts of spaceflight on plant telomeres and telomerase have not been examined. Here we report on the telomere dynamics of Arabidopsis thaliana grown aboard the International Space Station. We observe no changes in telomere length in space-flown Arabidopsis seedlings, despite a dramatic increase in telomerase activity (up to 150-fold in roots), as well as elevated genome oxidation. Ground-based follow up studies provide further evidence that telomerase is induced by different environmental stressors, but its activity is uncoupled from telomere length. Supporting this conclusion, genetically engineered super-telomerase lines with enhanced telomerase activity maintain wildtype telomere length. Finally, genome oxidation is inversely correlated with telomerase activity levels. We propose a redox protective capacity for Arabidopsis telomerase that may promote survivability in harsh environments. Telomeres are proposed to be sentinels for stress. Here, the authors report a strong induction of telomerase in space-flown Arabidopsis without telomere length changes. Instead, telomerase activity is inversely correlated with genome oxidation",html/json-ld,10.1038/s41467-023-41510-4,

To help understand the plant response to this complex suite of factors this study compared transcriptomic analysis of 15 Arabidopsis thaliana spaceflight experiments deposited in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s GeneLab data repository. These data were reanalyzed for genes showing significant differential expression in spaceflight versus ground controls using a single common computational pipeline for either the microarray or the RNA-seq datasets. Such a standardized approach to analysis should greatly increase the robustness of comparisons made between datasets. This analysis was coupled with extensive cross-referencing to a curated matrix of metadata associated with these experiments. Our study reveals that factors such as analysis type (i.e., microarray versus RNA-seq) or environmental and hardware conditions have important confounding effects on comparisons seeking to define plant reactions to spaceflight. The metadata matrix allows selection of studies with high similarity scores, i.e., that share multiple elements of experimental design, such as plant age or flight hardware. Comparisons between these studies then helps reduce the complexity in drawing conclusions arising from comparisons made between experiments with very different designs.",html/json-ld,10.1038/s41526-023-00247-6,

Dysregulated circadian rhythms are characteristic of aging and crewed spaceflight, associated with, for example, musculoskeletal atrophy. Molecular insights into spaceflight-related alterations of circadian regulation in skeletal muscle are still missing. Here, we investigated potential functional consequences of clock disruptions on skeletal muscle using published omics datasets obtained from spaceflights and other clock-altering, external (fasting and exercise), or internal (aging) conditions on Earth. Our analysis identified alterations of the clock network and skeletal muscle-associated pathways, as a result of spaceflight duration in mice, which resembles aging-related gene expression changes observed in humans on Earth (e.g., ATF4 downregulation, associated with muscle atrophy). Furthermore, according to our results, external factors such as exercise or fasting lead to molecular changes in the core-clock network, which may compensate for the circadian disruption observed during spaceflights. Thus, maintaining circadian functioning is crucial to ameliorate unphysiological alterations and musculoskeletal atrophy reported among astronauts.",html/json-ld,10.1038/s41526-023-00273-4,

At present, few researches have explored DNA methylation dynamics during long-term isolation. In this study, using time series DNA methylation data from ""Mars-500"" mission, we conducted a multi-step analysis to investigate the characteristics and dynamic patterns of DNA methylation as well as their functional insights during long-term isolation. The results showed that genome-wide methylation changes were minimal. In the six identified DNA methylation dynamic patterns, most of significantly fluctuating CpG sites could be returned to the baseline in post-isolation, and the remaining sites persistently decreased during isolation. Next, functional enrichment analysis of genes with each pattern revealed strong functional specificity. Some patterns were also significantly associated with nervous system diseases, digestive system diseases and cancers. In conclusion, the DNA methylation dynamics during long-term isolation have great functional significance, and might be helpful for protection of astronaut health.",html/json-ld,10.1016/j.isci.2022.104493,

The International Space Station (ISS) is ideal for investigating microbial diversity and virulence associated with spaceflight. The shotgun metagenomics data of the ISS generated during the Microbial Tracking-1 (MT-1) project and resulting metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) across three flights in eight different locations during 12 months were used in this study. The objective of this study was to identify the AMR genes associated with whole genomes of 226 cultivable strains, 21 shotgun metagenome sequences, and 24 MAGs retrieved from the ISS environmental samples that were treated with propidium monoazide (PMA; viable microbes).</p><h3>Results</h3><p>We have analyzed the data using a deep learning model, allowing us to go beyond traditional cut-offs based only on high DNA sequence similarity and extending the catalog of AMR genes. Our results in PMA treated samples revealed AMR dominance in the last flight for Kalamiella piersonii, a bacteria related to urinary tract infection in humans. The analysis of 226 pure strains isolated from the MT-1 project revealed hundreds of antibiotic resistance genes from many isolates, including two top-ranking species that corresponded to strains of Enterobacter bugandensis and Bacillus cereus. Computational predictions were experimentally validated by antibiotic resistance profiles in these two species, showing a high degree of concordance. Specifically, disc assay data confirmed the high resistance of these two pathogens to various beta-lactam antibiotics.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Overall, our computational predictions and validation analyses demonstrate the advantages of machine learning to uncover concealed AMR determinants in metagenomics datasets, expanding the understanding of the ISS environmental microbiomes and their pathogenic potential in humans.

The antimicrobial susceptibility testing of ISS strains and two related clinical isolates demonstrated that ISS strains acquired more resistance, specifically with regard to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins, despite no prediction of increased resistance based on genomic analysis of resistance genes. By investigating 402 longitudinal environmental and host-associated ISS metagenomes, we observed that viable A. pittii is increasing in relative abundance and therefore potentially exhibiting succession, being identified in &gt;2X more metagenomic samples in back-to-back missions. ISS strains additionally contain functions that enable them to survive in harsh environments, including the transcriptional regulator LexA. Via a genome-wide association study, we identified a high level of mutational burden in methionine sulfoxide reductase genes relative to the most closely related Earth strains.</p><h3>Conclusions</h3><p>Overall, these results indicated a step forward in understanding how microorganisms might evolve and alter their antibiotic resistance phenotype in extreme, resource-limited, human-built environments.

Recent findings have linked microgravity and transcriptomic changes in genes relating to cell wall synthesis and modification, oxidative stress, abiotic stressors, phytohormones, sugar synthesis and metabolism, ribosomal biogenesis, and plant defense to other organisms. Although we have a better-established profile of the transcriptomic response of plants to reduced gravity, some areas of study have not yet been thoroughly investigated. The initial stages and progression of transcriptional responses to microgravity, the responses of additional plant species, and tissue-specific transcriptional responses to microgravity should all be further investigated in order to better develop our understanding of how plants react to a reduced gravity environment.

In order to evaluate and reduce possible pathological reactions triggered by space environments, we conducted bioinformatics analyses on the methylation data of the Mars 520 mission and human transcriptome data in the experiment simulating gravity changes. The results suggest that gene expression levels and DNA methylation levels were changed under the conditions of isolation and gravity changes, and multiple viral infection-related pathways were found in the enrichment analysis results of changed genes including Epstein Barr virus (EBV) infection, Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KHSV) infection. In this study, we found that Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) and vitamin D are helpful in reducing viral infection risk. In addition, the causal associations between nutrients and viral infections were calculated using Two sample Mendelian Randomization (2SMR) method, the results indicated that vitamin D can reduce EBV infection and HBV infection risk. In summary, our study suggests that space environments increase the risk of human viral infection, which may be reduced by supplementing EGCG and vitamin D.

An integrative graph-theoretic network-based drug repurposing methodology quantifying the interplay of key gene regulations and protein-protein interactions in muscle atrophy conditions is presented. Transcriptomic datasets from mice in spaceflight from GeneLab have been extensively mined to extract the key genes that cause muscle atrophy in organ muscle tissues such as the thymus, liver, and spleen. Top muscle atrophy gene regulators are selected by Bayesian Markov blanket method and gene-disease knowledge graph is constructed using the scalable precision medicine knowledge engine. A deep graph neural network is trained for predicting links in the network. The top ranked diseases are identified and drugs are selected for repurposing using drug bank resource. A disease drug knowledge graph is constructed and the graph neural network is trained for predicting new drugs. The results are compared with machine learning methods such as random forest, and gradient boosting classifiers. Network measure based methods shows that preferential attachment has good performance for link prediction in both the gene-disease and disease-drug graphs. The receiver operating characteristic curves, and prediction accuracies for each method show that the random walk similarity measure and deep graph neural network outperforms the other methods. Several key target genes identified by the graph neural network are associated with diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and neural disorders. The novel link prediction approach applied to the disease drug knowledge graph identifies the Monoclonal Antibodies drug therapy as suitable candidate for drug repurposing for spaceflight induced microgravity. There are a total of 21 drugs identified as possible candidates for treating muscle atrophy.

Collected blood was profiled with a hematology analyzer and spleens were analyzed by whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing (RNA-sequencing). The results revealed negligible differences in immune differentials. However, hematological system analyses of whole blood indicated large disparities in red blood cell differentials and morphology, suggestive of anemia. Murine Reactome networks indicated majority of spleen cells displayed differentially expressed genes (DEG) involved in signal transduction, metabolism, cell cycle, chromatin organization, and DNA repair. Although immune differentials were not changed, DEG analysis of the spleen revealed expression profiles associated with inflammation and dysregulated immune function persist to 1-week post-simulated spaceflight. Additionally, specific regulation pathways associated with human blood disease gene orthologs, such as blood pressure regulation, transforming growth factor-β receptor signaling, and B cell differentiation were noted.

Mice were euthanized on-orbit, livers and spleens dissected, and remaining tissues frozen in situ for later analyses. Mice appeared healthy by daily video health checks and body, adrenal, and spleen weights of 37d-flight (FLT) mice did not differ from ground controls housed in flight hardware (GC), while thymus weights were 35% greater in FLT than GC.

This platform provides the scientific community a valuable resource for exploring, evaluating, and discovering hypotheses of space biology. In the platform we offer users multiple tools to explore GeneLab data including: a comprehensive, well-annotated data repository for all space related omics data, omics data analysis tools, space environmental metadata, and differential gene expression visualization tools. Here we focus on the latter, and how these tools can be utilized to explore scientific questions related to space biology. Spaceflight is known to create many health risks in astronauts due to both microgravity and space radiation exposure. Current research is focused on the underlying biological mechanisms behind these health risks and potential countermeasures to mitigate these health risks. One specific health risk is related to increased liver damage during exposure to the space environment (Beheshti et al, Scientific Reports, 2019). Longer exposure to the space environment appears to cause increased lipid accumulation and transcriptomic analysis suggests pathways and genes related to liver disease (i.e. PPARα, Insulin or INS, and Glucagon or GCG) can be activated. We use this scenario to demonstrate how GeneLab’s platform and visualization capabilities can be utilized to quickly reveal this process in GeneLab platform data. Lastly, we discuss some issues and best practices for implementing similar, public- platform visualization tools.

725,Comparison of Bacillus subtilis transcriptome profiles from two separate missions to the International Space Station,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41526-018-0061-0,1/7/2019,2019,"The human spaceflight environment is notable for the unique factor of microgravity, which exerts numerous physiologic effects on macroscopic organisms, but how this environment may affect single-celled microbes is less clear. In an effort to understand how the microbial transcriptome responds to the unique environment of spaceflight, the model Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis was flown on two separate missions to the International Space Station in experiments dubbed BRIC-21 and BRIC-23. Cells were grown to late-exponential/early stationary phase, frozen, then returned to Earth for RNA-seq analysis in parallel with matched ground control samples. A total of 91 genes were significantly differentially expressed in both experiments; 55 exhibiting higher transcript levels in flight samples and 36 showing higher transcript levels in ground control samples. Genes upregulated in flight samples notably included those involved in biofilm formation, biotin and arginine biosynthesis, siderophores, manganese transport, toxin production and resistance, and sporulation inhibition. Genes preferentially upregulated in ground control samples notably included those responding to oxygen limitation, e.g., fermentation, anaerobic respiration, subtilosin biosynthesis, and anaerobic regulatory genes. The results indicated differences in oxygen availability between flight and ground control samples, likely due to differences in cell sedimentation and the toroidal shape assumed by the liquid cultures in microgravity.",html/json-ld,10.1038/s41526-018-0061-0,

Moreover, given the infrequency of these experiments it is imperative that their impacts be maximized. The rapid advancement of omics technologies offers an opportunity to dramatically increase the volume of data produced from precious spaceflight specimens. To capitalize on this, NASA has developed the GeneLab platform to provide unrestricted access to spaceflight omics data and encourage its widespread analysis. Rodents (both rats and mice) are common model organisms used by scientists to investigate space-related biological impacts. The enclosure that house rodents during spaceflight are called Rodent Habitats (formerly Animal Enclosure Modules), and are substantially different from standard vivarium cages in their dimensions, air flow, and access to water and food. In addition, due to environmental and atmospheric conditions on the International Space Station (ISS), animals are exposed to a higher CO2 concentration. We recently reported that mice in the Rodent Habitats experience large changes in their transcriptome irrespective of whether animals were on the ground or in space. Furthermore, these changes were consistent with a hypoxic response, potentially driven by higher CO2 concentrations. Here we describe how a typical rodent experiment is performed in space, how omics data from these experiments can be accessed through the GeneLab platform, and how to identify key factors in this data. Using this process, any individual can make critical discoveries that could change the design of future space missions and activities.",html/json-ld,10.3791/58447,

730,Multi-omics analysis of multiple missions to space reveal a theme of lipid dysregulation in mouse liver,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-55869-2,12/16/2019,2019,"Spaceflight has several detrimental effects on the physiology of astronauts, many of which are recapitulated in rodent models. Mouse studies performed on the Space Shuttle showed disruption of lipid metabolism in liver. However, given that these animals were not sacrificed on-orbit and instead returned live to earth, it is unclear if these disruptions were solely induced by space stressors (e.g. microgravity, space radiation) or in part explained by the stress of return to Earth. In this work we analyzed three liver datasets from two different strains of mice (C57BL/6 (Jackson) &amp; BALB/c (Taconic)) flown aboard the International Space Station (ISS). Notably, these animals were sacrificed on-orbit and exposed to varying spaceflight durations (i.e. 21, 37, and 42 days vs 13 days for the Shuttle mice). Oil Red O (ORO) staining showed abnormal lipid accumulation in all space-flown mice compared to ground controls regardless of strain or exposure duration. Similarly, transcriptomic analysis by RNA-sequencing revealed several pathways that were affected in both strains related to increased lipid metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, lipid and fatty acid processing, lipid catabolic processing, and lipid localization. In addition, key upstream regulators were predicted to be commonly regulated across all conditions including Glucagon (GCG) and Insulin (INS). Moreover, quantitative proteomic analysis showed that a number of lipid related proteins were changed in the livers during spaceflight. Taken together, these data indicate that activation of lipotoxic pathways are the result of space stressors alone and this activation occurs in various genetic backgrounds during spaceflight exposures of weeks to months. If similar responses occur in humans, a prolonged change of these pathways may result in the development of liver disease and should be investigated further.",html/json-ld,10.1038/s41598-019-55869-2,
731,Reproducible changes in the gut microbiome suggest a shift in microbial and host metabolism during spaceflight,https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-019-0724-4,8/9/2019,2019,"Space environment imposes a range of challenges to mammalian physiology and the gut microbiota, and interactions between the two are thought to be important in mammalian health in space. While previous findings have demonstrated a change in the gut microbial community structure during spaceflight, specific environmental factors that alter the gut microbiome and the functional relevance of the microbiome changes during spaceflight remain elusive. We profiled the microbiome using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing in fecal samples collected from mice after a 37-day spaceflight onboard the International Space Station. We developed an analytical tool, named STARMAPs (Similarity Test for Accordant and Reproducible Microbiome Abundance Patterns), to compare microbiome changes reported here to other relevant datasets. We also integrated the gut microbiome data with the publically available transcriptomic data in the liver of the same animals for a systems-level analysis. We report an elevated microbiome alpha diversity and an altered microbial community structure that were associated with spaceflight environment. Using STARMAPs, we found the observed microbiome changes shared similarity with data reported in mice flown in a previous space shuttle mission, suggesting reproducibility of the effects of spaceflight on the gut microbiome. However, such changes were not comparable with those induced by space-type radiation in Earth-based studies. We found spaceflight led to significantly altered taxon abundance in one order, one family, five genera, and six species of microbes. This was accompanied by a change in the inferred microbial gene abundance that suggests an altered capacity in energy metabolism. Finally, we identified host genes whose expression in the liver were concordantly altered with the inferred gut microbial gene content, particularly highlighting a relationship between host genes involved in protein metabolism and microbial genes involved in putrescine degradation. These observations shed light on the specific environmental factors that contributed to a robust effect on the gut microbiome during spaceflight with important implications for mammalian metabolism. Our findings represent a key step toward a better understanding the role of the gut microbiome in mammalian health during spaceflight and provide a basis for future efforts to develop microbiota-based countermeasures that mitigate risks to crew health during long-term human space expeditions.",html/json-ld,10.1186/s40168-019-0724-4,
732,A microRNA signature and TGF-β1 response were identified as the key master regulators for spaceflight response,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0199621,7/25/2018,2018,Translating fundamental biological discoveries from NASA Space Biology program into health risk from space flights has been an ongoing challenge. We propose to use NASA GeneLab database to gain new knowledge on potential systemic responses to space. Unbiased systems biology analysis of transcriptomic data from seven different rodent datasets reveals for the first time the existence of potential “master regulators” coordinating a systemic response to microgravity and/or space radiation with TGF-β1 being the most common regulator. We hypothesized the space environment leads to the release of biomolecules circulating inside the blood stream. Through datamining we identified 13 candidate microRNAs (miRNA) which are common in all studies and directly interact with TGF-β1 that can be potential circulating factors impacting space biology. This study exemplifies the utility of the GeneLab data repository to aid in the process of performing novel hypothesis–based research.,html/json-ld,10.1371/journal.pone.0199621,

We assessed the ""FAIRness"" of NASA's GeneLab Data Systems (GLDS) along with four similar kinds of systems in the research omics data domain, using 14 FAIRness metrics. The range of overall FAIRness scores was 6-12 (out of 14), average 10.1, and standard deviation 2.4. The range of Pass ratings for the metrics was 29-79%, Partial Pass 0-21%, and Fail 7-50%. The systems we evaluated performed the best in the areas of data findability and accessibility, and worst in the area of data interoperability. Reusability of metadata, in particular, was frequently not well supported. We relate our experiences implementing semantic integration of omics data from some of the assessed systems for federated querying and retrieval functions, given their shortcomings in data interoperability. Finally, we propose two new principles that Big Data system developers, in particular, should consider for maximizing data accessibility.",html/json-ld,,
734,Global transcriptomic analysis suggests carbon dioxide as an environmental stressor in spaceflight: A systems biology GeneLab case study,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-22613-1,3/8/2018,2018,"Spaceflight introduces a combination of environmental stressors, including microgravity, ionizing radiation, changes in diet and altered atmospheric gas composition. In order to understand the impact of each environmental component on astronauts it is important to investigate potential influences in isolation. Rodent spaceflight experiments involve both standard vivarium cages and animal enclosure modules (AEMs), which are cages used to house rodents in spaceflight. Ground control AEMs are engineered to match the spaceflight environment. There are limited studies examining the biological response invariably due to the configuration of AEM and vivarium housing. To investigate the innate global transcriptomic patterns of rodents housed in spaceflight-matched AEM compared to standard vivarium cages we utilized publicly available data from the NASA GeneLab repository. Using a systems biology approach, we observed that AEM housing was associated with significant transcriptomic differences, including reduced metabolism, altered immune responses, and activation of possible tumorigenic pathways. Although we did not perform any functional studies, our findings revealed a mild hypoxic phenotype in AEM, possibly due to atmospheric carbon dioxide that was increased to match conditions in spaceflight. Our investigation illustrates the process of generating new hypotheses and informing future experimental research by repurposing multiple space-flown datasets.",html/json-ld,10.1038/s41598-018-22613-1,

However, these experiments have been conducted using a variety of organisms, media, culture conditions, and spaceflight hardware, and to date no cross-experiment analyses have been performed to uncover possible commonalities in their responses. In this study, eight bacterial transcriptome datasets deposited in NASA’s GeneLab Data System were standardized through a common bioinformatics pipeline then subjected to meta-analysis to identify among the datasets (i) individual genes which might be significantly differentially expressed, or (ii) gene sets which might be significantly enriched. Neither analysis resulted in identification of responses shared among all datasets.

It is essential to have a detailed understanding of the biological effects on humans living and working in deep space. Ionizing radiation from galactic cosmic rays (GCR) is a major health risk factor for astronauts on extended missions outside the protective effects of the Earth's magnetic field. Currently, there are gaps in our knowledge of the health risks associated with chronic low-dose, low-dose-rate ionizing radiation, specifically ions associated with high (H) atomic number (Z) and energy (E). The NASA GeneLab project ( https://genelab.nasa.gov/ ) aims to provide a detailed library of omics datasets associated with biological samples exposed to HZE. The GeneLab Data System (GLDS) includes datasets from both spaceflight and ground-based studies, a majority of which involve exposure to ionizing radiation. In addition to detailed information on radiation exposure for ground-based studies, GeneLab is adding detailed, curated dosimetry information for spaceflight experiments. GeneLab is the first comprehensive omics database for space-related research from which an investigator can generate hypotheses to direct future experiments, utilizing both ground and space biological radiation data.

Microbes when exposed to excess moisture, such as from an unexpected ventilation system failure, can undergo growth that is associated with material degradation and negative health effects. However, we do not yet understand how exposure of these microbes to excess moisture alters their function. A de novo metatranscriptomic study was performed using dust collected from the US air filtration system of the ISS and incubated in laboratory chambers on Earth at different equilibrium relative humidity (ERH)&nbsp;levels. Changes in fungal function (gene expression) were significantly associated with moisture (adonis2 p = 0.0001). Secondary metabolism and fungal growth genes were upregulated (FDR-adjusted p ≤ 0.001, log2FC ≥ 2) at elevated ERH compared to 50% ERH. Elevated moisture conditions showed upregulation of aflatoxin and fungal allergen genes such as Asp f 4 (log2FC = 26.4, upregulated at 85% ERH compared to 50%) and Alt a 7 (log2FC = 2.98, upregulated at 100% ERH compared to 50%).

This study analyzes the transcriptomic changes experienced by Adineta vaga, a bdelloid rotifer aboard the International Space Station (ISS), using RNA sequencing. The aim was to investigate the overall effect of spaceflight in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) on these organisms. To this end, new hardware was developed to enable autonomous culturing of rotifers with minimal astronaut intervention. The study revealed significant transcriptomic changes, with 18.61% of genes showing differential expression in response to microgravity and radiation. These changes included upregulation of genes involved in protein synthesis, RNA metabolic processes, and DNA repair. Notably, the study also found a significant enrichment of foreign genes (Horizontal Gene Transfers: HGTs) among the genes that were either over- or under-expressed during spaceflight, suggesting that HGTs play a role in bdelloids’ adaptability to new and potentially atypical environments. This research not only enhances our understanding of how organisms respond to microgravity but also proposes A. vaga as a valuable model for future studies in space biology.",html/json-ld,10.1186/s12915-025-02272-1,

Here the effects of simulated microgravity (SµG) on gene expression and genome evolution of E. coli REL606, a strain evolved terrestrially for 35 years, is explored. The transcriptomic changes for glucose-limited and glucose-replete conditions over 24 h illustrate that SµG increased the expression of genes involved in stress response, biofilm, and metabolism. A greater number of differentially expressed genes related to the general stress response (GSR) and biofilm formation is observed in simulated microgravity cultures under glucose-limited conditions in comparison to glucose-replete conditions. Longer term SµG culture under glucose-limited conditions led to the accumulation of unique mutations when compared to control cultures, particularly in the mraZ/fruR intergenic region and the elyC gene, suggesting changes in peptidoglycan and enterobacterial common antigen (ECA) production. These findings highlight the physiological and genomic adaptations of E. coli to microgravity, offering a foundation for future research into the long-term effects of space conditions on bacterial evolution.",html/json-ld,10.1186/s12866-025-04064-7,

743,Impact of simulated microgravity on the growth and proteomic profile of Enterobacter cloacae,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40272176/,6/3/2025,2025,"Previous studies have shown decreased microbial diversity in astronaut gut microbiomes during spaceflight, raising potential health concerns. <i>Enterobacter cloacae</i>, a commensal member of the human gastrointestinal tract microbiota, has the potential to cause opportunistic infections in immunocompromised patients. However, little is known about how <i>E. cloacae</i> cells adapt to extreme environments such as microgravity, and whether this bacterium is of medical concern for astronauts during long-term spaceflight missions, as astronaut immune systems are compromised by microgravity. To this end, <i>E. cloacae</i> growth and proteomic profiles were obtained from high aspect ratio vessel (HARV) cultures grown in the rotary cell culture system (RCCS) in three orientations: low-shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG), normal gravity (NG; oxygenation membrane on bottom), and inverted normal gravity (INV; oxygenation membrane on top). Both NG and INV controls were included to determine if <i>E. cloacae</i> LSMMG and INV HARV cultures overlapped in their growth properties and/or proteomics profiles, as was previously observed for <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>. Our results revealed significant proteomic changes in <i>E. cloacae</i> that overlapped in LSMMG and INV conditions compared to NG, suggesting that adaptive responses may be driven by both simulated microgravity and orientation of the oxygenation membrane. These findings offer insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying <i>E. cloacae</i>'s adaptation to microgravity and its potential health risks for astronauts. This study also underlines the importance of multiple control orientations in ground-based microgravity simulations using the RCCS, guiding future research on microbial behavior in space conditions.IMPORTANCE<i>Enterobacter cloacae</i> can transition from a gut commensal to an opportunistic pathogen in immunocompromised hosts and in closed environments such as hospitals. This danger can be exacerbated by the emergence of multidrug-resistant <i>E. cloacae</i> strains. Astronauts undergo changes in their immune systems during spaceflight that could predispose them to infection and spend extended time in the International Space Station and other closed environments. Therefore, elucidating the impacts of actual spaceflight and simulated microgravity on the biology of <i>E. cloacae</i> and other commensal organisms is vital due to the challenges of antibiotic treatment (such as limited shelf life) during extended spaceflight missions. The findings in this study highlight the importance of using multiple control conditions in ground-based microgravity simulations and lay groundwork for future research into microbial adaptation to space and other extreme environments.",html/json-ld,10.1128/spectrum.02446-24,

In this study, we tested the hypothesis that bone loss during spaceflight in Low Earth Orbit is primarily associated with site-specific microgravity unloading of weight-bearing sites in the skeleton. Microcomputed tomography and histological analyses of bones from mice space flown on ISS for 37 days in the NASA Rodent Research-1 experiment show significant site-specific cancellous and cortical bone loss occurring in the femur, but not in L2 vertebrae. The lack of bone degenerative effects in the spine in combination with same-animal paired losses in the femur suggests that space radiation levels in Low Earth Orbit or other systemic stresses are not likely to significantly contribute to the observed bone loss. Remarkably, spaceflight is also associated with accelerated progression of femoral head endochondral ossification. This suggests the microgravity environment promotes premature progression of secondary ossification during late stages of skeletal maturation at 21 weeks. Furthermore, mice housed in the NASA ISS Rodent Habitat during 1g ground controls maintained or gained bone relative to mice housed in standard vivarium cages that showed significant bone mass declines. These findings suggest that housing in the Rodent Habitat with greater topological enrichment from 3D wire-mesh surfaces may promote increased mechanical loading of weight-bearing bones and maintenance of bone mass. In summary, our results indicate that in female mice approaching skeletal maturity, mechanical unloading of weight-bearing sites is the major cause of bone loss in microgravity, while sites loaded predominantly by muscle activity, such as the spine, appear unaffected. Additionally, we identified early-onset of femoral head epiphyseal plate secondary ossification as a novel spaceflight skeletal unloading effect that may lead to premature long bone growth arrest in microgravity.",html/json-ld,10.1371/journal.pone.0317307,

Microgravity is a major component of the spaceflight environment which could have adverse effects on ocular health. The use of centrifugation to exert forces that partially or fully mimic Earth-level gravity in space is a possible countermeasure to mitigate the effects of microgravity on the eye. Therefore, we subjected mice on the International Space Station (ISS) to microgravity (0 G) or artificial gravity by centrifugation at 0.33 G, 0.67 G, and 1 G, and then performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on optic nerve and retinal tissue after returning them to Earth alive. We find that the microgravity environment induces transcriptomic changes in the optic nerve and retina consistent with an increased oxidative stress load, inflammation, apoptosis, and lipid metabolic stress. We also find that adding artificial gravity on board the ISS attenuates the transcriptomic response to microgravity in a dose-dependent manner. Such attenuation may effectively protect from and mitigate spaceflight-induced detrimental effects on ocular tissue.",html/json-ld,10.3390/ijms252212041,

In this study, we employed an innovative approach by integrating single-cell multiomics (transcriptomics and chromatin accessibility) with spatial transcriptomics to elucidate the impact of spaceflight on the mouse brain in female mice. Our comparative analysis between ground control and spaceflight-exposed animals revealed significant alterations in essential brain processes including neurogenesis, synaptogenesis and synaptic transmission, particularly affecting the cortex, hippocampus, striatum and neuroendocrine structures. Additionally, we observed astrocyte activation and signs of immune dysfunction. At the pathway level, some spaceflight-induced changes in the brain exhibit similarities with neurodegenerative disorders, marked by oxidative stress and protein misfolding. Our integrated spatial multiomics approach serves as a stepping stone towards understanding spaceflight-induced CNS impairments at the level of individual brain regions and cell types, and provides a basis for comparison in future spaceflight studies.

In this study, an automated heart-on-a-chip platform was flown to the International Space Station on a 1-mo mission during which contractile cardiac function was monitored in real-time. Upon return to Earth, engineered human heart tissues (EHTs) were further analyzed with ultrastructural imaging and RNA sequencing to investigate the impact of prolonged microgravity on cardiomyocyte function and health. Spaceflight EHTs exhibited significantly reduced twitch forces, increased incidences of arrhythmias, and increased signs of sarcomere disruption and mitochondrial damage. Transcriptomic analyses showed an up-regulation of genes and pathways associated with metabolic disorders, heart failure, oxidative stress, and inflammation, while genes related to contractility and calcium signaling showed significant down-regulation.

754,Predicting how varying moisture conditions impact the microbiome of dust collected from the International Space Station,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39256883/,9/10/2024,2024,"<h3>Background</h3><p>The commercialization of space travel will soon lead to many more people living and working in unique built environments similar to the International Space Station, which is a specialized closed environment that contains its own indoor microbiome. Unintended microbial growth can occur in these environments as in buildings on Earth from elevated moisture, such as from a temporary ventilation system failure. This growth can drive negative health outcomes and degrade building materials. We need a predictive approach for modeling microbial growth in these critical indoor spaces.</p><h3>Results</h3><p>Here, we demonstrate that even short exposures to varying elevated relative humidity can facilitate rapid microbial growth and microbial community composition changes in dust from spacecraft. We modeled fungal growth in dust from the International Space Station using the time-of-wetness framework with activation and deactivation limited growth occurring at 85% and 100% relative humidity, respectively. Fungal concentrations ranged from an average of 4.4 × 10<sup>6</sup> spore equivalents per milligram of dust in original dust with no exposure to relative humidity to up to 2.1 × 10<sup>10</sup> when exposed to 100% relative humidity for 2 weeks. As relative humidity and time-elevated increased, fungal diversity was significantly reduced for both alpha (Q &lt; 0.05) and beta (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.307, P = 0.001) diversity metrics. Bacteria were unable to be modeled using the time-of-wetness framework. However, bacterial communities did change based on constant relative humidity incubations for both beta (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.22, P = 0.001) and alpha diversity decreasing with increasing moisture starting at 85% relative humidity (Q &lt; 0.05).</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Our results demonstrate that moisture conditions can be used to develop and predict changes in fungal growth and composition onboard human-occupied spacecraft. This predictive model can be expanded upon to include other spacecraft environmental factors such as microgravity, elevated carbon dioxide conditions, and radiation exposure. Understanding microbial growth in spacecraft can help better protect astronaut health, fortify spacecraft integrity, and promote planetary protection as human activity increases in low-Earth orbit, the moon, Mars, and beyond.

We used this unique environment to evaluate the effects of microgravity on kidney proximal tubule epithelial cell (PTEC) response to serum exposure and vitamin D biotransformation capacity. To test if microgravity alters the pathologic response of the proximal tubule to serum exposure, we treated PTECs cultured in a microphysiological system (PT-MPS) with human serum and measured biomarkers of toxicity and inflammation (KIM-1 and IL-6) and conducted global transcriptomics via RNAseq on cells undergoing flight (microgravity) and respective controls (ground). Given the profound bone loss observed in microgravity and PTECs produce the active form of vitamin D, we treated 3D cultured PTECs with 25(OH)D3 (vitamin D) and monitored vitamin D metabolite formation, conducted global transcriptomics via RNAseq, and evaluated transcript expression of CYP27B1, CYP24A1, or CYP3A5 in PTECs undergoing flight (microgravity) and respective ground controls. We demonstrated that microgravity neither altered PTEC metabolism of vitamin D nor did it induce a unique response of PTECs to human serum, suggesting that these fundamental biochemical pathways in the kidney proximal tubule are not significantly altered by short-term exposure to microgravity. Given the prospect of extended spaceflight, more study is needed to determine if these responses are consistent with extended (&gt;6 months) exposure to microgravity.",html/json-ld,10.1038/s41526-024-00415-2,

Newer, nanopore-based sequencing technologies can quantitatively map changes in chemical structure and expression at single molecule resolution across entire isoforms. We perform long-read, direct RNA nanopore sequencing, as well as Ultima high-coverage RNA-sequencing, of whole blood sampled longitudinally from four SpaceX Inspiration4 astronauts at seven timepoints, spanning pre-flight, day of return, and post-flight recovery. We report key genetic pathways, including changes in erythrocyte regulation, stress induction, and immune changes affected by spaceflight. We also present the first m6A methylation profiles for a human space mission, suggesting a significant spike in m6A levels immediately post-flight. These data and results represent the first longitudinal long-read RNA profiles and RNA modification maps for each gene for astronauts, improving our understanding of the human transcriptome’s dynamic response to spaceflight.

However, documenting microbial shifts during spaceflight has been difficult due to mission constraints that lead to limited sampling and profiling. Here we executed a six-month longitudinal study to quantify the high-resolution human microbiome response to three days in orbit for four individuals. Using paired metagenomics and metatranscriptomics alongside single-nuclei immune cell profiling, we characterized time-dependent, multikingdom microbiome changes across 750 samples and 10 body sites before, during and after spaceflight at eight timepoints. We found that most alterations were transient across body sites; for example, viruses increased in skin sites mostly during flight. However, longer-term shifts were observed in the oral microbiome, including increased plaque-associated bacteria (for example, Fusobacteriota), which correlated with immune cell gene expression. Further, microbial genes associated with phage activity, toxin–antitoxin systems and stress response were enriched across multiple body sites. In total, this study reveals in-depth characterization of microbiome and immune response shifts experienced by astronauts during short-term spaceflight and the associated changes to the living environment, which can help guide future missions, spacecraft design and space habitat planning.

Bacteriophages are prolific mediators of bacterial adaptation on Earth. Here we survey 245 genomes sequenced from bacterial strains isolated on the International Space Station for dormant (lysogenic) bacteriophages. Our analysis indicates phage-associated genes are significantly different between spaceflight strains and their terrestrial counterparts. In addition, we identify 283 complete prophages, those that could initiate bacterial lysis and infect additional hosts, of which 21% are novel. These prophage regions encode functions that correlate with increased persistence in extreme environments, such as spaceflight, to include antimicrobial resistance and virulence, DNA damage repair, and dormancy. Our results correlate microbial adaptation in spaceflight to bacteriophage-encoded functions that may impact human health in spaceflight. Viruses that infect bacteria shape microbial communities.

In 2021, the SpaceX Inspiration4 mission launched the first all-civilian crew to low Earth orbit, which included the youngest American astronaut (aged 29), new in-flight experimental technologies (handheld ultrasound imaging, smartwatch wearables and immune profiling), ocular alignment measurements and new protocols for in-depth, multi-omic molecular and cellular profiling. Here we report the primary findings from the 3-day spaceflight mission, which induced a broad range of physiological and stress responses, neurovestibular changes indexed by ocular misalignment, and altered neurocognitive functioning, some of which match those of&nbsp;long-term spaceflight2, but almost all of which did not differ from baseline (pre-flight) after return to Earth. Overall, these preliminary civilian spaceflight data suggest that short-duration missions do not pose a significant health risk, and moreover present a rich opportunity to measure the earliest phases of adaptation to spaceflight in the human body at anatomical, cellular, physiological and cognitive levels. Finally, these methods and results lay the foundation for an open, rapidly expanding biomedical database for astronauts3, which can inform countermeasure development for both private and government-sponsored space missions.

Liquid biopsies allow for minimally-invasive multi-omics assessments that can resolve the molecular heterogeneity of internal tissues. Here, we report initial results from the JAXA Cell-Free Epigenome Study, a liquid biopsy study with six astronauts who resided on the International Space Station (ISS) for more than 120 days. Analysis of plasma cell-free RNA (cfRNA) collected before, during, and after spaceflight confirms previously reported mitochondrial dysregulation in space. Screening with 361 cell surface marker antibodies identifies a mitochondrial DNA-enriched fraction associated with the scavenger receptor CD36. RNA-sequencing of the CD36 fraction reveals tissue-enriched RNA species, suggesting the plasma mitochondrial components originated from various tissues. We compare our plasma cfRNA data to mouse plasma cfRNA data from a previous JAXA mission, which had used on-board artificial gravity, and discover a link between microgravity and the observed mitochondrial responses. It has been reported that a spaceflight causes mitochondrial stress in astronauts. Here the authors suggest that mitochondrial components are released into the plasma during spaceflight as components of CD36-marked extracellular vesicles (EVs).",html/json-ld,10.1038/s41467-023-41995-z,

To investigate the impact of short-duration spaceflight on the skin, we conducted skin biopsies on the Inspiration4 crew members before (L-44) and after (R + 1) flight. Leveraging multi-omics assays including GeoMx™ Digital Spatial Profiler, single-cell RNA/ATAC-seq, and metagenomics/metatranscriptomics, we assessed spatial gene expressions and associated microbial and immune changes across 95 skin regions in four compartments: outer epidermis, inner epidermis, outer dermis, and vasculature. Post-flight samples showed significant up-regulation of genes related to inflammation and KRAS signaling across all skin regions. These spaceflight-associated changes mapped to specific cellular responses, including altered interferon responses, DNA damage, epithelial barrier disruptions, T-cell migration, and hindered regeneration were located primarily in outer tissue compartments. We also linked epithelial disruption to microbial shifts in skin swab and immune cell activity to PBMC single-cell data from the same crew and timepoints. Our findings present the inaugural collection and examination of astronaut skin, offering insights for future space missions and response countermeasures. Here the authors profile skin microenvironment changes in response to spaceflight by performing a multi omics analysis using skin punch biopsies from the crew members of SpaceX Inspiration4 mission comparing before, post launch and one day after return 91 of the 3-day mission.",html/json-ld,10.1038/s41467-024-48625-2,

In astronauts, longitudinal monitoring of physiological systems and interactions between these systems are important to consider for mitigation strategies. In addition, assessments of sex-specific biological responses in the unique environment of spaceflight are vital to support future exploration missions that include both females and males. Here we assessed sex-specific, multi-system immune and endocrine responses to simulated cosmic radiation. For this, 24-week-old, male and female C57Bl/6J mice were exposed to simplified five-ion, space-relevant galactic cosmic ray (GCRsim) radiation at 15 and 50 cGy, to simulate predicted radiation exposures that would be experienced during lunar and Martian missions, respectively. Blood and adrenal tissues were collected at 3- and 14-days post-irradiation for analysis of immune and endocrine biosignatures and pathways. Sexually dimorphic adrenal gland weights and morphology, differential total RNA expression with corresponding gene ontology, and unique immune phenotypes were altered by GCRsim. In brief, this study offers new insights into sexually dimorphic immune and endocrine kinetics following simulated cosmic radiation exposure and highlights the necessity for personalized translational approaches for astronauts during exploration missions.",html/json-ld,10.1038/s41598-023-33629-7,

Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) revealed distinct spaceflight associated methylation differences, presenting the need to explore specific space-altered methylation at single-molecule resolution to associate specific changes over large regions of spaceflight related genes. To date, tools of multiplexed targeted DNA methylation sequencing remain limited for plant genomes.</p><h3>Results</h3><p>To provide methylation data at single-molecule resolution, Flap-enabled next-generation capture (FENGC), a novel targeted multiplexed DNA capture and enrichment technique allowing cleavage at any specified sites, was applied to survey spaceflight-altered DNA methylation in genic regions of interest. The FENGC capture panel contained 108 targets ranging from 509 to 704 nt within the promoter or gene body regions of gene targets derived from spaceflight whole-genome data sets. In addition to genes with significant changes in expression and average methylation levels between spaceflight and ground control, targets with space-altered distributions of the proportion of methylated cytosines per molecule were identified. Moreover, trends of co-methylation of different cytosine contexts were exhibited in the same DNA molecules. We further identified significant DNA methylation changes in three previously biological process-unknown genes, and loss-of-function mutants of two of these genes (named as EMO1 and EMO2 for ELP2-regulated Methylation in Orbit 1 and 2) showed enhanced root growth rate.</p><h3>Conclusions</h3><p>FENGC simplifies and reduces the cost of multiplexed, targeted, single-molecule profiling of methylation in plants, providing additional resolution along each DNA molecule that is not seen in population-based short-read data such as WGBS. This case study has revealed spaceflight-altered regional modification of cytosine methylation occurring within single DNA molecules of cell subpopulations, which were not identified by WGBS. The single-molecule survey by FENGC can lead to identification of novel functional genes.

Astronauts spending steadily increasing lengths of time in microgravity are subject to cardiovascular deconditioning resulting in loss of vascular tone, reduced total blood volume, and diminished cardiac output. Appreciating the mechanisms by which the cells of the vasculature are altered during spaceflight will be integral to understanding and combating these deleterious effects as the human presence in space advances. In this study, we performed RNA-Seq analysis coupled with review by QIAGEN Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software on human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs) cultured for 3 days in microgravity and aboard the International Space Station to assess the transcriptomic changes that occur during spaceflight. The results of our RNA-Seq analysis show that SMCs undergo a wide range of transcriptional alteration while in space, significantly affecting 4422 genes. SMCs largely down-regulate markers of the contractile, synthetic, and osteogenic phenotypes including smooth muscle alpha actin (αSMA), matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs). Additionally, components of several cellular signaling pathways were strongly impacted including the STAT3, NFκB, PI3K/AKT, HIF1α, and Endothelin pathways.

As part of the Space Biofilms project, biofilms of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were grown in spaceflight over material surfaces. Stainless Steel 316 (SS316) and passivated SS316 were tested for their relevance as spaceflight hardware components, while a lubricant impregnated surface (LIS) was tested as potential biofilm control strategy. The morphology and gene expression of biofilms were characterized. Biofilms in microgravity are less robust than on Earth. LIS strongly inhibits biofilm formation compared to SS. Furthermore, this effect is even greater in spaceflight than on Earth, making LIS a promising option for spacecraft use.

This method called glycome profiling (glycomics) revealed global differences in non-cellulosic cell wall epitopes in Arabidopsis thaliana root extracts recovered from RNA purification columns between seedlings grown on the International Space Station-based Vegetable Production System and paired ground (1-g) controls. Immunohistochemistry on 11-day-old seedling primary root sections showed that ten of twenty-two mAbs that exhibited spaceflight-induced increases in binding through glycomics, labeled space-grown roots more intensely than those from the ground. The ten mAbs recognized xyloglucan, xylan, and arabinogalactan epitopes. Notably, three xylem-enriched unsubstituted xylan backbone epitopes were more intensely labeled in space-grown roots than in ground-grown roots, suggesting that the spaceflight environment accelerated root secondary cell wall formation. This study highlights the feasibility of glycomics for high-throughput evaluation of cell wall glycans using only root high alkaline extracts from RNA purification columns, and subsequent validation of these results by immunohistochemistry. This approach will benefit plant space biological studies because it extends the analyses possible from the limited amounts of samples returned from spaceflight and help uncover microgravity-induced tissue-specific changes in plant cell walls.",html/json-ld,10.1038/s41526-023-00312-0,

The experiment examined the operationalization of Kennedy Space Center Fixation Tubes (KFTs) as a generalizable approach to preserving biology at various phases of suborbital flight. The biology chosen for this experiment was Arabidopsis thaliana, ecotype Col-0, because of the plant history of spaceflight experimentation within KFTs and wealth of comparative data from orbital experiments. KFTs were deployed as a wearable device, a leg pouch attached to the astronaut, which proved to be operationally effective during the course of the flight. Data from the inflight samples indicated that the microgravity period of the flight elicited the strongest transcriptomic responses as measured by the number of genes showing differential expression. Genes related to reactive oxygen species and stress, as well as genes associated with orbital spaceflight, were highly represented among the suborbital gene expression profile. In addition, gene families largely unaffected in orbital spaceflight were diversely regulated in suborbital flight, including stress-responsive transcription factors.

These machines continuously alter the sample’s orientation, so the acceleration vector changes faster than the biological endpoint being monitored. Two commercially available microgravity simulators are the Rotary Cell Culture System (Synthecon Inc.), which is a 2D clinostat, and the RPM 2.0 (Yuri), which is a 3D clinostat that can operate as a random positioning machine or in constant frame velocity mode. We have developed an inexpensive 3D clinostat that can be 3D printed and assembled easily. To determine the optimal combination of inner (I) and outer (O) frame velocities to simulate microgravity, two factors were considered: the time-averaged magnitude and the distribution of the acceleration vector. A computer model was developed to predict the acceleration vector for combinations of frame velocities between 0.125 revolutions per minute (rpm) and 4 rpm, and a combination of I=1.5 rpm and O=3.875 rpm was predicted to produce the best microgravity simulation. Two other frame velocity combinations were also used in further tests: I=0.75 rpm and O=3.625 rpm, and I=2 rpm and O=1.125 rpm. By operating the RPM 2.0 in constant velocity mode at these three velocity combinations, the RPM 2.0 algorithm data confirmed that these operating conditions simulated microgravity. Mycobacterium marinum was selected for biological comparison experiments as this bacterium can grow as a biofilm or a planktonic culture. Biofilm experiments revealed that the RPM 2.0 and the 3D clinostat with I=1.5 rpm and O=3.825 rpm produced similar structures in attached biofilm, and similar changes in transcriptome for the bacteria in suspension compared to the normal gravity transcriptome. Operating the 3D clinostat at I=2rpm and O=1.125 rpm, and the Synthecon 2D clinostat in simulated microgravity orientation at 25 rpm resulted in the same decreased planktonic growth and increased rifampicin survival compared to normal gravity. This study validates the inexpensive 3D clinostat and demonstrates the importance of testing the operating conditions of lab-developed clinostats with biological experiments.",html/json-ld,10.3389/frspt.2022.1032610,

In this study, we apply a computational approach to predict possible metabolic interactions in the ISS microbiome and shed further light on its organization. Through a combination of a systems-based graph-theoretical approach, and a constraint-based community metabolic modeling approach, we demonstrated several key interactions in the ISS microbiome. These complementary approaches provided insights into the metabolic interactions and dependencies present amongst various microbes in a community, highlighting key interactions and keystone species. Our results showed that the presence of K. pneumoniae is beneficial to many other microorganisms it coexists with, notably those from the Pantoea genus. Species belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae family were often found to be the most beneficial for the survival of other microorganisms in the ISS microbiome. However, K. pneumoniae was found to exhibit parasitic and amensalistic interactions with Aspergillus and Penicillium species, respectively. To prove this metabolic prediction, K. pneumoniae and Aspergillus fumigatus were co-cultured under normal and simulated microgravity, where K. pneumoniae cells showed parasitic characteristics to the fungus. The electron micrography revealed that the presence of K. pneumoniae compromised the morphology of fungal conidia and degenerated its biofilm-forming structures. Our study underscores the importance of K. pneumoniae in the ISS, and its potential positive and negative interactions with other microbes, including potential pathogens. This integrated modeling approach, combined with experiments, demonstrates the potential for understanding the organization of other such microbiomes, unravelling key organisms and their interdependencies.",html/json-ld,10.1186/s40168-022-01279-y,

The Microbial Tracking 1 (MT-1) project was the first ISS environmental surface study to report on the metagenome profiles without using whole-genome amplification. The study surveyed the microbial communities from eight surfaces over a 14-month period. The Microbial Tracking 2 (MT-2) project aimed to continue the work of MT-1, sampling an additional four flights from the same locations, over another 14 months. Eight surfaces across the ISS were sampled with sterile wipes and processed upon return to Earth. DNA extracted from the processed samples (and controls) were treated with propidium monoazide (PMA) to detect intact/viable cells or left untreated and to detect the total DNA population (free DNA/compromised cells/intact cells/viable cells). DNA extracted from PMA-treated and untreated samples were analyzed using shotgun metagenomics. Samples were cultured for bacteria and fungi to supplement the above results. Staphylococcus sp. and Malassezia sp. were the most represented bacterial and fungal species, respectively, on the ISS. Overall, the ISS surface microbiome was dominated by organisms associated with the human skin. Multi-dimensional scaling and differential abundance analysis showed significant temporal changes in the microbial population but no spatial differences. The ISS antimicrobial resistance gene profiles were however more stable over time, with no differences over the 5-year span of the MT-1 and MT-2 studies. Twenty-nine antimicrobial resistance genes were detected across all samples, with macrolide/lincosamide/streptogramin resistance being the most widespread. Metagenomic assembled genomes were reconstructed from the dataset, resulting in 82 MAGs. Functional assessment of the collective MAGs showed a propensity for amino acid utilization over carbohydrate metabolism. Co-occurrence analyses showed strong associations between bacterial and fungal genera. Culture analysis showed the microbial load to be on average 3.0 × 105 cfu/m2 Utilizing various metagenomics analyses and culture methods, we provided a comprehensive analysis of the ISS surface microbiome, showing microbial burden, bacterial and fungal species prevalence, changes in the microbiome, and resistome over time and space, as well as the functional capabilities and microbial interactions of this unique built microbiome. Data from this study may help to inform policies for future space missions to ensure an ISS surface microbiome that promotes astronaut health and spacecraft integrity.",html/json-ld,10.1186/s40168-022-01293-0,
781,Mouse genomic associations with in vitro sensitivity to simulated space radiation,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36682829/,2/1/2023,2023,"Exposure to ionizing radiation is considered by NASA to be a major health hazard for deep space exploration missions. Ionizing radiation sensitivity is modulated by both genomic and environmental factors. Understanding their contributions is crucial for designing experiments in model organisms, evaluating the risk of deep space (i.e. high-linear energy transfer, or LET, particle) radiation exposure in astronauts, and also selecting therapeutic irradiation regimes for cancer patients. We identified single nucleotide polymorphisms in 15 strains of mice, including 10 collaborative cross model strains and 5 founder strains, associated with spontaneous and ionizing radiation-induced in vitro DNA damage quantified based on immunofluorescent tumor protein p53 binding protein (53BP1) positive nuclear foci. Statistical analysis suggested an association with pathways primarily related to cellular signaling, metabolism, tumorigenesis and nervous system damage. We observed different genomic associations in early (4 and 8 h) responses to different LET radiation, while later (24 hour) DNA damage responses showed a stronger overlap across all LETs. Furthermore, a subset of pathways was associated with spontaneous DNA damage, suggesting 53BP1 positive foci as a potential biomarker for DNA integrity in mouse models. Our results suggest several mouse strains as new models to further study the impact of ionizing radiation and validate the identified genetic loci. We also highlight the importance of future human in vitro studies to refine the association of genes and pathways with the DNA damage response to ionizing radiation and identify targets for space travel countermeasures.",html/json-ld,10.1016/j.lssr.2022.07.006,

Using samples from Apollo 11, 12, and 17, we show that the terrestrial plant Arabidopsis thaliana germinates and grows in diverse lunar regoliths. However, our results show that growth is challenging; the lunar regolith plants were slow to develop and many showed severe stress morphologies. Moreover, all plants grown in lunar soils differentially expressed genes indicating ionic stresses, similar to plant reactions to salt, metal and reactive oxygen species. Therefore, although in situ lunar regoliths can be useful for plant production in lunar habitats, they are not benign substrates. The interaction between plants and lunar regolith will need to be further elucidated, and likely mitigated, to best enable efficient use of lunar regolith for life support within lunar stations. Arabidopsis plants were seeded onto lunar soil samples taken directly from the Apollo 11, 12, and 17 missions.

A growing body of data from ground-based experiments indicates that exposure to space radiation doses (approximating those that astronauts will be exposed to on a mission to Mars) impairs a variety of cognitive processes, including cognitive flexibility tasks. Some studies report that 33% of individuals may experience severe cognitive impairment. Translating the results from ground-based rodent studies into tangible risk estimates for astronauts is an enormous challenge, but it would be germane for NASA to use the vast body of data from the rodent studies to start developing appropriate countermeasures, in the expectation that some level of space radiation (SR) -induced cognitive impairment could occur in astronauts. While some targeted studies have reported radiation-induced changes in the neurotransmission properties and/or increased neuroinflammation within space radiation exposed brains, there remains little information that can be used to start the development of a mechanism-based countermeasure strategy. In this study, we have employed a robust label-free mass spectrometry (MS) -based untargeted quantitative proteomic profiling approach to characterize the composition of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) proteome in rats that have been exposed to 15 cGy of 600 MeV/n 28Si ions. A variety of analytical techniques were used to mine the generated expression data, which in such studies is typically hampered by low and variable sample size. We have identified several pathways and proteins whose expression alters as a result of space radiation exposure, including decreased mitochondrial function, and a further subset of proteins differs in rats that have a high level of cognitive performance after SR exposure in comparison with those that have low performance levels.While this study has provided further insight into how SR impacts upon neurophysiology, and what adaptive responses can be invoked to prevent the emergence of SR-induced cognitive impairment, the main objective of this paper is to outline strategies that can be used by others to analyze sub-optimal data sets and to identify new information.",html/json-ld,10.3389/fphys.2022.971282,

However, our mechanistic understanding of how these environments regulate host-pathogen interactions in humans is poorly understood. Using a spaceflight analogue low fluid shear culture system, we investigated the effect of Low Shear Modeled Microgravity (LSMMG) culture on the colonization of Salmonella Typhimurium in a 3-D biomimetic model of human colonic epithelium containing macrophages. RNA-seq profiling of stationary phase wild type and hfq mutant bacteria alone indicated that LSMMG culture induced global changes in gene expression in both strains and that the RNA-binding protein Hfq played a significant role in regulating the transcriptional response of the pathogen to LSMMG culture. However, a core set of genes important for adhesion, invasion, and motility were commonly induced in both strains. LSMMG culture enhanced the colonization (adherence, invasion and intracellular survival) of Salmonella in this advanced model of intestinal epithelium using a mechanism that was independent of Hfq. Although S. Typhimurium hfq mutants are normally defective for invasion when grown as conventional shaking cultures, LSMMG conditions unexpectedly enabled high levels of colonization by an isogenic hfq mutant. In response to infection with either the wild type or mutant, host cells upregulated transcripts involved in inflammation, tissue remodeling, and wound healing during intracellular survival. Interestingly, infection by the hfq mutant led to fewer transcriptional differences between LSMMG- and control-infected host cells relative to infection with the wild type strain. This is the first study to investigate the effect of LSMMG culture on the interaction between S. Typhimurium and a 3-D model of human intestinal tissue. These findings advance our understanding of how physical forces can impact the early stages of human enteric salmonellosis.",html/json-ld,10.3389/fcimb.2022.705647,

Rotating suspension culture technology has not been widely implemented, in large part because the vessels are prohibitively expensive, labor-intensive to use, and are difficult to scale for industrial applications. Our solution addresses each of these challenges in a new vessel called a cell spinpod. These small 3.5&nbsp;mL capacity vessels are constructed from injection-molded thermoplastic polymer components. They contain self-sealing axial silicone rubber ports, and fluoropolymer, breathable membranes. Here we report the two-fluid modeling of the flow and stresses in cell spinpods. Cell spinpods were used to demonstrate the effect of fluid shear stress on renal cell gene expression and cellular functions, particularly membrane and xenobiotic transporters, mitochondrial function, and myeloma light chain, cisplatin and doxorubicin, toxicity. During exposure to myeloma immunoglobulin light chains, rotation increased release of clinically validated nephrotoxicity cytokine markers in a toxin-specific pattern. Addition of cisplatin or doxorubicin nephrotoxins reversed the enhanced glucose and albumin uptake induced by fluid shear stress in rotating cell spinpod cultures. Cell spinpods are a simple, inexpensive, easily automated culture device that enhances cellular functions for in vitro studies of nephrotoxicity.",html/json-ld,10.1038/s41598-021-00304-8,

The microorganisms that associate with plant tissues play a critical role in improving plant health and production. To that end, we developed a methodology to investigate the transcriptional activities of the microbiome of red romaine lettuce, a key salad crop that was grown under International Space Station (ISS)-like conditions. Microbial transcripts enriched from host–microbe total RNA were sequenced using the Oxford Nanopore MinION sequencing platform. Results show that this enrichment approach was highly reproducible and could be an effective approach for the on-site detection of microbial transcriptional activity.

The sequence similarity of these three ISS strains, designated as IF7SW-B2T, IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5, was <99.4% for 16S rRNA genes and <97.3% for gyrB gene, with the closest being Methylobacterium indicum SE2.11T.

The average nucleotide identity (ANI) values of these three ISS strains were <93% and digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH) values were <46.4% with any described Methylobacterium species. Based on the ANI and dDDH analyses, these three ISS strains were considered as novel species belonging to the genus Methylobacterium. The three ISS strains showed 100% ANI similarity and dDDH values with each other, indicating that these three ISS strains, isolated during various flights and at different locations, belong to the same species. These three ISS strains were found to grow optimally at temperatures from 25°C to 30°C, pH 6.0 to 8.0, and NaCl 0 to 1%. Phenotypically, these three ISS strains resemble M. aquaticum and M. terrae since they assimilate similar sugars as sole carbon substrate when compared to other Methylobacterium species. Fatty acid analysis showed that the major fatty acid produced by the ISS strains are C18:1- ω7c and C18:1- ω6c. The predominant quinone was ubiquinone 10, and the major polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, and an unidentified lipid. Therefore, based on genomic, phylogenetic, biochemical, and fatty acid analyses, strains IF7SW-B2T, IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5, are assigned to a novel species within the genus Methylobacterium, and the name Methylobacterium ajmalii sp. nov. is proposed.

To determine the impact of seed sanitization on the plants’ microbiome and pathogen persistence, sanitized and unsanitized seeds from two leafy green crops, red Romaine lettuce (Lactuca sativa cv. ‘Outredgeous’) and mizuna mustard (Brassica rapa var. japonica) were exposed to Escherichia coli and grown in controlled environment growth chambers simulating environmental conditions aboard the International Space Station. Plants were harvested at four intervals from 7 days post-germination to maturity. The bacterial communities of leaf and root were investigated using the 16S rRNA sequencing while quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and heterotrophic plate counts were used to reveal the persistence of E. coli. E. coli was detectable for longer periods of time in plants from sanitized versus unsanitized seeds and was identified in root tissue more frequently than in leaf tissue. 16S rRNA sequencing showed dynamic changes in the abundance of members of the phylum Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidetes in leaf and root samples of both leafy crops. We observed minimal changes in the microbial diversity of lettuce or mizuna leaf tissue with time or between sanitized and unsanitized seeds. Beta-diversity showed that time had more of an influence on all samples versus the E. coli treatment.

Transcriptomics evidence supported a response to HS in the rat retina that was affected by age and sex. Several molecular networks suggested stress imposed by HS affected the retinal vasculature, oxidative and inflammation status, pigmented epithelium and glia. The CSNK1A1-TP53 pathway was implicated in the response in all cohorts. Sex-specific genes were involved in cytoprotection and may explain sex-dependent vulnerabilities to certain eye diseases.

In order to understand this, the salivary microbiome was analyzed with 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, and saliva viral titers were analyzed with quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) with primers specific for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), and varicella zoster virus (VZV) from 10 astronauts pre-flight, in-flight, and post-flight. Streptococcus was the most abundant organism in the saliva, making up 8% of the total organisms detected, and their diversity decreased during spaceflight. Other organisms that had statistically significant changes were Proteobacteria and Fusobacteria which increased during flight and Actinobacteria which decreased during flight. At the genus level, Catonella, Megasphera, and Actinobacillus were absent in more than half of saliva samples collected pre-flight but were then detected during flight. In those subjects that already had these genera pre-flight, their relative abundances increased during flight. Correlation analyses between the microbiome and viral titers revealed a positive correlation with Gracilibacteria, Absconditabacteria, and Abiotrophia and a negative correlation between Oribacterium, Veillonella, and Haemophilus. There was also a significant positive correlation between microbiome richness and EBV viral titers. This is the first study to look at how the salivary microbiome changes as a result of spaceflight and the search for bacterial biomarkers for viral reactivation. Further studies examining the role of specific organisms that were shown to be correlative and predictive in viral reactivation, a serious problem in astronauts during spaceflight, could lead to mitigation strategies to help prevent disease during both short and long duration space missions.",html/json-ld,10.1186/s40168-020-00830-z,

To address this deficiency, articular cartilage (AC) and sternal cartilage (SC) from mice exposed to 30 days of microgravity on the BION-M1 craft were investigated for pathological changes. The flight AC showed some evidence of degradation at the tissue level with loss of proteoglycan staining and a reduction in mRNA expression of mechano-responsive and structural cartilage matrix proteins compared to non-flight controls. These data suggest that degradative changes are underway in the AC extracellular matrix exposed to microgravity. In contrast, there was no evidence of cartilage breakdown in SC flight samples and the gene expression profile was distinct from that of AC with a reduction in metalloproteinase gene transcription. Since the two cartilages respond differently to microgravity we propose that each is tuned to the biomechanical environments in which they are normally maintained. That is, the differences between magnitude of normal terrestrial loading and the unloading of microgravity dictates the tissue response. Weight-bearing articular cartilage, but not minimally loaded sternal fibrocartilage, is negatively affected by the unloading of microgravity. We speculate that the maintenance of physiological loading on AC during spaceflight will minimize AC damage.",html/json-ld,10.1038/s41526-019-0063-6,

After simulation, a transcriptomic analysis was performed with two subpopulations of cells (G2/M and G1 phases enriched) and an asynchronous culture sample. Differential expression was found at cell proliferation, energy/redox and stress responses, plus unknown biological processes gene ontology groups. Overall expression inhibition was a common response to simulated microgravity, but differences peak at the G2/M phase and stress response components change dramatically from G2/M to the G1 subpopulation suggesting a differential adaptation response to simulated microgravity through the cell cycle.

However, its effect on the antibody repertoire, especially in response to challenge, has not been well characterized. The development of the repertoire has multiple steps that could be affected by spaceflight, including V-(D-)J-gene segment rearrangement and the selection of complementarity determining regions (CDRs); specifically, CDR3, responsible for much of the diversity in the repertoire. We used skeletal unloading with the antiorthostatic suspension (AOS) model to simulate some of the physiological effects associated with spaceflight. Animals ± AOS were challenged with tetanus toxoid (TT) and/or CpG, an adjuvant. Two weeks after challenge, bone marrow was collected and sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq 2 × 300 platform. The resulting antibody repertoire was characterized, including V-, D- (heavy only), and J-gene segment usage, constant region usage, CDR3 length, and V(D)J combinations. We detected changes in gene-segment usage in response to AOS, TT, and CpG treatment in both the heavy and light chains. Additionally, changes were seen in the class-switched VH-gene repertoire. Alterations were also detected in V/J pairing for both the heavy and light chains, and changes in CDR3 length. We also detected lower levels of CDR3 AA overlap than detected in the splenic repertoire. These results demonstrate that AOS, TT, and CpG alter the bone marrow antibody repertoire however, it is still unclear from the data whether there is a loss of host antigen-specific responsiveness because of the change in gene use.",html/json-ld,10.1016/j.lssr.2019.06.001,

When plants are grown in the novel environment of spaceflight aboard the International Space Station (ISS), an environment completely outside their evolutionary history, they respond with unique alterations to their gene expression profile. Identifying the genes important for physiological adaptation to spaceflight and dissecting the biological processes and pathways engaged by plants during spaceflight has helped reveal spaceflight adaptation, and has furthered understanding of terrestrial growth processes. However, the underlying regulatory mechanisms responsible for these changes in gene expression patterns are just beginning to be explored. Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation at position five in cytosine, has been shown to play a role in the physiological adaptation to adverse terrestrial environments, and may play a role in spaceflight as well. Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing of DNA of Arabidopsis grown on the ISS from seed revealed organ-specific patterns of differential methylation compared to ground controls. The overall levels of methylation in CG, CHG, and CHH contexts were similar between flight and ground DNA, however, thousands of specifically differentially methylated cytosines were discovered, and there were clear organ-specific differences in methylation patterns. Spaceflight leaves had higher methylation levels in CHG and CHH contexts within protein-coding genes in spaceflight; about a fifth of the leaf genes were also differentially regulated in spaceflight, almost half of which were associated with reactive oxygen signaling. The physiological adaptation of plants to spaceflight is likely nuanced by epigenomic modification. This is the first examination of differential genomic methylation from plants grown completely in the spaceflight environment of the ISS in plant growth hardware developed for informing exploration life support strategies. Yet even in this optimized plant habitat, plants respond as if stressed. These data suggest that gene expression associated with physiological adaptation to spaceflight is regulated in part by methylation strategies similar to those engaged with familiar terrestrial stress responses. The differential methylation maps generated here provide a useful reference for elucidating the layers of regulation of spaceflight responses.",html/json-ld,10.1186/s12864-019-5554-z,

Microarray gene expression data were analyzed using a two-part comparative approach. First, genes differentially expressed between the two environments (spaceflight to ground) were identified within the same genotype, which represented physiological adaptation to spaceflight. Second, gene expression profiles were compared between the two genotypes (HSFA2 KO to WT) within the same environment, which defined genes uniquely required by each genotype on the ground and in spaceflight-adapted states. Results showed that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and unfolded protein response (UPR) define the HSFA2 KO cells' physiological state irrespective of the environment, and likely resulted from a deficiency in the chaperone-mediated protein folding machinery in the mutant. Results further suggested that additional to its universal stress response role, <i>HsfA2</i> also has specific roles in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight through cell wall remodeling, signal perception and transduction, and starch biosynthesis. Disabling <i>HsfA2</i> altered the physiological state of the cells, and impacted the mechanisms induced to adapt to spaceflight, and identified <i>HsfA2</i>-dependent genes that are important to the adaption of wild type cells to spaceflight.

Whole genome sequences of ISS strains were characterized using the hybrid de novo assembly of Nanopore and Illumina reads. In addition to traditional microbial taxonomic approaches, multilocus sequence typing (MLST) analysis was performed to classify the phylogenetic lineage. Agar diffusion discs assay was performed to test antibiotics susceptibility. The draft genomes after assembly and scaffolding were annotated with the Rapid Annotations using Subsystems Technology and RNAmmer servers for downstream analysis. Molecular phylogeny and whole genome analysis of the ISS strains with all publicly available Enterobacter genomes revealed that ISS strains were E. bugandensis and similar to the type strain EB-247T and two clinical isolates (153_ECLO and MBRL 1077). Comparative genomic analyses of all eight E. bungandensis strains showed, a total of 4733 genes were associated with carbohydrate metabolism (635 genes), amino acid and derivatives (496 genes), protein metabolism (291 genes), cofactors, vitamins, prosthetic groups, pigments (275 genes), membrane transport (247 genes), and RNA metabolism (239 genes).

Culture-based analyses, targeted gene-based amplicon sequencing (bacteriome, mycobiome, and resistome), and shotgun metagenomics approaches have previously been performed on ISS environmental sample sets using whole genome amplification (WGA). However, this is the first study reporting on the metagenomes sampled from ISS environmental surfaces without the use of WGA. Metagenome sequences generated from eight defined ISS environmental locations in three consecutive flights were analyzed to assess the succession and persistence of microbial communities, their antimicrobial resistance (AMR) profiles, and virulence properties. Metagenomic sequences were produced from the samples treated with propidium monoazide (PMA) to measure intact microorganisms. The intact microbial communities detected in Flight 1 and Flight 2 samples were significantly more similar to each other than to Flight 3 samples. Among 318 microbial species detected, 46 species constituting 18 genera were common in all flight samples. Risk group or biosafety level 2 microorganisms that persisted among all three flights were Acinetobacter baumannii, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella enterica, Shigella sonnei, Staphylococcus aureus, Yersinia frederiksenii, and Aspergillus lentulus. Even though Rhodotorula and Pantoea dominated the ISS microbiome, Pantoea exhibited succession and persistence. K. pneumoniae persisted in one location (US Node 1) of all three flights and might have spread to six out of the eight locations sampled on Flight 3. The AMR signatures associated with β-lactam, cationic antimicrobial peptide, and vancomycin were detected. Prominent virulence factors were cobalt-zinc-cadmium resistance and multidrug-resistance efflux pumps. There was an increase in AMR and virulence gene factors detected over the period sampled, and metagenome sequences of human pathogens persisted over time. Comparative analysis of the microbial compositions of ISS with Earth analogs revealed that the ISS environmental surfaces were different in microbial composition.

Genes that are important in establishing the spaceflight responses are being identified, their roles in spaceflight physiological adaptation are increasingly understood, and the fact that different genotypes adapt differently is recognized. However, the basic question of whether these spaceflight responses are actually required for survival has yet to be posed, and the fundamental notion that spaceflight responses may be non-adaptive has yet to be explored. Therefore the experiments presented here were designed to ask if portions of the plant spaceflight response can be genetically removed without causing loss of spaceflight survival and without causing increased stress responses. The CARA experiment compared the spaceflight transcriptome responses in the root tips of two Arabidopsis ecotypes, Col-0 and WS, as well as that of a PhyD mutant of Col-0. When grown with the ambient light of the ISS, phyD plants displayed a significantly reduced spaceflight transcriptome response compared to Col-0, suggesting that altering the activity of a single gene can actually improve spaceflight adaptation by reducing the transcriptome cost of physiological adaptation. The WS genotype showed an even simpler spaceflight transcriptome response in the ambient light of the ISS, more broadly indicating that the plant genotype can be manipulated to reduce the cost of spaceflight adaptation, as measured by transcriptional response. These differential genotypic responses suggest that genetic manipulation could further reduce, or perhaps eliminate the metabolic cost of spaceflight adaptation. When plants were germinated and then left in the dark on the ISS, the WS genotype actually mounted a larger transcriptome response than Col-0, suggesting that the in-space light environment affects physiological adaptation, which implies that manipulating the local habitat can also substantially impact the metabolic cost of spaceflight adaptation.",html/json-ld,10.1371/journal.pone.0180186,

Although there were increases noted in corticosterone levels in both the adrenals and liver, there were no significant changes in catecholamine levels. Furthermore, functional analysis of gene expression and metabolomic profiles suggest that the functional changes are not due to oxidative or psychological stress. Despite changes in gene expression patterns indicative of increases in phagocytic activity (e.g. endocytosis and formation of peroxisomes), there was no corresponding increase in genes related to ROS metabolism. In contrast, there were increases in expression profiles related to fatty acid oxidation with decreases in glycolysis-related profiles.

Furthermore, metagenome mining was carried out to characterize dominant, virulent, and novel microorganisms. The whole genome sequences of select cultivable strains isolated from these samples were extracted from the metagenome and compared. Species-level composition in the ISS was found to be largely dominated by Corynebacterium ihumii GD7, with overall microbial diversity being lower in the ISS relative to the cleanroom samples. When examining detection of microbial genes relevant to human health such as antimicrobial resistance and virulence genes, it was found that a larger number of relevant gene categories were observed in the ISS relative to the cleanroom. Strain-level cross-sample comparisons were made for Corynebacterium, Bacillus, and Aspergillus showing possible distinctions in the dominant strain between samples. Species-level analyses demonstrated distinct differences between the ISS and cleanroom samples, indicating that the cleanroom population is not necessarily reflective of space habitation environments. The overall population of viable microorganisms and the functional diversity inherent to this unique closed environment are of critical interest with respect to future space habitation. Observations and studies such as these will be important to evaluating the conditions required for long-term health of human occupants in such environments.",html/json-ld,10.1186/s40168-017-0292-4,

846,"Exposure of Mycobacterium marinum to low-shear modeled microgravity: effect on growth, the transcriptome and survival under stress",https://www.nature.com/articles/npjmgrav201638,12/1/2016,2016,"Waterborne pathogenic mycobacteria can form biofilms, and certain species can cause hard-to-treat human lung infections. Astronaut health could therefore be compromised if the spacecraft environment or water becomes contaminated with pathogenic mycobacteria. This work uses Mycobacterium marinum to determine the physiological changes in a pathogenic mycobacteria grown under low-shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG). M. marinum were grown in high aspect ratio vessels (HARVs) using a rotary cell culture system subjected to LSMMG or the control orientation (normal gravity, NG) and the cultures used to determine bacterial growth, bacterium size, transcriptome changes, and resistance to stress. Two exposure times to LSMMG and NG were examined: bacteria were grown for ~40 h (short), or 4 days followed by re-dilution and growth for ~35 h (long). M. marinum exposed to LSMMG transitioned from exponential phase earlier than the NG culture. They were more sensitive to hydrogen peroxide but showed no change in resistance to gamma radiation or pH 3.5. RNA-Seq detected significantly altered transcript levels for 562 and 328 genes under LSMMG after short and long exposure times, respectively. Results suggest that LSMMG induced a reduction in translation, a downregulation of metabolism, an increase in lipid degradation, and increased chaperone and mycobactin expression. Sigma factor H (sigH) was the only sigma factor transcript induced by LSMMG after both short and long exposure times. In summary, transcriptome studies suggest that LSMMG may simulate a nutrient-deprived environment similar to that found within macrophage during infection. SigH is also implicated in the M. marinum LSMMG transcriptome response. Microgravity alters gene expression in a pathogenic waterborne microbe — changes that could pose a health risk to astronauts in space. Lynn Harrison from the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center in Shreveport, USA, and colleagues grew an infectious bacterium called Mycobacterium marinum, a close relative to the microbe responsible for tuberculosis, in a rotary cell culture system that causes the low fluid shear dynamics associated with microgravity. Bacteria in this state grew slower with different expression levels of several hundred genes compared to those cultured under normal gravity conditions. Some of these molecular differences are similar to those elicited when mycobacteria infect human cells, suggesting that space might make the microbes more pathogenic. However, microgravity also made the bacteria more sensitive to certain stressors like hydrogen peroxide, so the overall impact on virulence is still unclear.",html/json-ld,10.1038/npjmgrav.2016.38,

Microgravity-induced alterations in liver metabolism, particularly with respect to lipids, remain largely unexplored. Here we utilize a novel systems biology approach, combining metabolomics and transcriptomics with advanced Raman microscopy, to investigate altered hepatic lipid metabolism in mice following short duration spaceflight. Mice flown aboard Space Transportation System -135, the last Shuttle mission, lose weight but redistribute lipids, particularly to the liver. Intriguingly, spaceflight mice lose retinol from lipid droplets. Both mRNA and metabolite changes suggest the retinol loss is linked to activation of PPARα-mediated pathways and potentially to hepatic stellate cell activation, both of which may be coincident with increased bile acids and early signs of liver injury. Although the 13-day flight duration is too short for frank fibrosis to develop, the retinol loss plus changes in markers of extracellular matrix remodeling raise the concern that longer duration exposure to the space environment may result in progressive liver damage, increasing the risk for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.",html/json-ld,10.1371/journal.pone.0152877,

The purpose of this study was to determine whether spaceflight alters gene expression profiles and induces oxidative damage in the retina. Ten week old adult C57BL/6 male mice were flown aboard the ISS for 35 days and returned to Earth alive. Ground control mice were maintained on Earth under identical environmental conditions. Within 38 (+/−4) hours after splashdown, mice ocular tissues were collected for analysis. RNA sequencing detected 600 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in murine spaceflight retinas, which were enriched for genes related to visual perception, the phototransduction pathway, and numerous retina and photoreceptor phenotype categories. Twelve DEGs were associated with retinitis pigmentosa, characterized by dystrophy of the photoreceptor layer rods and cones. Differentially expressed transcription factors indicated changes in chromatin structure, offering clues to the observed phenotypic changes. Immunofluorescence assays showed degradation of cone photoreceptors and increased retinal oxidative stress. Total retinal, retinal pigment epithelium, and choroid layer thickness were significantly lower after spaceflight.

This community structure depends on numerous factors like nutrient availability, abiotic factors like temperature and pH as well as microbial composition. Categorising accessible biomes according to their habitats would help in understanding the complexity of the environment-specific communities. Owing to the recent improvements in sequencing facilities, researchers have started to explore diverse microbiomes rapidly and attempts have been made to study microbial crosstalk. However, different metagenomics sampling, preprocessing, and annotation methods make it difficult to compare multiple studies and hinder the recycling of data. Huge datasets originating from these experiments demand systematic computational methods to extract biological information beyond microbial compositions. Further exploration of microbial co-occurring patterns across the biomes could help us in designing cross-biome experiments. In this review, we catalogue databases with system-specific microbiomes, discussing publicly available common databases as well as specialised databases for a range of microbiomes. If the new datasets generated in the future could maintain at least biome-specific annotation, then researchers could use those contemporary tools for relevant and bias-free analysis of complex metagenomics data.",html/json-ld,10.1007/s41745-023-00370-z,

While microgravity-induced differential gene expression (DGE) has been extensively investigated, the contribution of differential alternative splicing (DAS) to the plasticity and functional status of the skeletal muscle transcriptome has not been studied in an animal model. Therefore, by evaluating both DGE and DAS across spaceflight, we set out to provide the first comprehensive characterization of the transcriptomic landscape of skeletal muscle during exposure to microgravity. RNA-sequencing, immunohistochemistry, and morphological analyses were conducted utilizing total RNA and tissue sections isolated from the gastrocnemius and quadriceps muscles of 30-week-old female BALB/c mice exposed to microgravity or ground control conditions for 9 weeks. In response to microgravity, the skeletal muscle transcriptome was remodeled via both DGE and DAS. Importantly, while DGE showed variable gene network enrichment, DAS was enriched in structural and functional gene networks of skeletal muscle, resulting in the expression of alternatively spliced transcript isoforms that have been associated with the physiological changes to skeletal muscle in microgravity, including muscle atrophy and altered fiber type function. Finally, RNA-binding proteins, which are required for regulation of pre-mRNA splicing, were themselves differentially spliced but not differentially expressed, an upstream event that is speculated to account for the downstream splicing changes identified in target skeletal muscle genes. Our work serves as the first investigation of coordinate changes in DGE and DAS in large limb muscles across spaceflight. It opens up a new opportunity to understand (i) the molecular mechanisms by which splice variants of skeletal muscle genes regulate the physiological adaptations of skeletal muscle to microgravity and (ii) how small molecule splicing regulator therapies might thwart muscle atrophy and alterations to fiber type function during prolonged spaceflight.",html/json-ld,10.1186/s13395-022-00294-9,

To clarify the underlying mechanism, we investigated whether estrogen receptor <i>α</i> (ERα)-NRF1-OMI-mitophagy signaling was involved in the dedifferentiation and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) under simulated microgravity. Phenotypic markers, mtDNA copy number and mitochondrial biogenesis, mitochondrial dynamics and mitophagy in rat thoracic artery smooth muscle cells were examined. Four-week hindlimb unweighting (HU) was used to simulate microgravity in rats and 10% serum was used to induce VSMCs dedifferentiation <i>in vitro</i>. The effects of ERα-NRF1-OMI signaling on mitophagy, phenotypic switching and proliferation of VSMCs, and cerebrovascular remodeling in HU rats were studied by genetic manipulation and chronic drug intervention. We found that ERα is positively associated with contractile phenotype switching but inversely correlated with synthetic phenotype switching and proliferation of VSMCs both <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i>. During the dedifferentiation process of VSMCs, reduced mtDNA copy number, disturbed mitochondrial biogenesis and respiration, and perturbed fission-fusion-mitophagy signaling were detected, which were reversed by ERα overexpression. Mechanistically, the ERα downstream protein OMI preserved the mitochondrial Parkin level by increasing its protein stability, thereby protecting mitophagy. In line with this, we found that activating ERα signaling by propyl pyrazole triol (PPT) could alleviate the synthetic phenotype switching and proliferation of HU rat cerebral VSMCs by reestablishing fission-fusion-mitophagy hemostasis. The current study clarified a novel mechanism by which inhibited ERα-NRF1-OMI-mitophagy signaling resulted in synthetic phenotype switching and proliferation of VSMCs and cerebrovascular remodeling under simulated microgravity.",html/json-ld,10.3389/fphys.2022.1039913,

Mitochondria are the most important energy metabolism organelles, and some studies demonstrate that the areospace microgravity environment can cause mitochondrial dysfunction. However, the relationships between cognitive function decline and mitochondrial dysfunction in the microgravity environment have not been elucidated. In this study, we simulated the microgravity environment in the Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats by -30° tail suspension for 28 days. We then investigated the changes of mitochondrial morphology and proteomics in the hippocampus. The electron microscopy results showed that the 28-day tail suspension increased the mitochondria number and size of rat hippocampal neuronal soma. Using TMT-based proteomics analysis, we identified 163 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) between tail suspension and control samples, and among them, 128 proteins were upregulated and 35 proteins were downregulated. Functional and network analyses of the DEPs indicated that several of mitochondrial metabolic processes including the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle were altered by simulating microgravity (SM). We verified 3 upregulated proteins, aconitate hydratase (ACO2), dihydrolipoamide S-succinyltransferase (DLST), and citrate synthase (CS), in the TCA cycle process by western blotting and confirmed their differential expressions between tail suspension and control samples. Taken together, our results demonstrate that 28-day tail suspension can cause changes in the morphology and metabolic function of hippocampus mitochondria, which might represent a mechanism of cognitive disorder caused by aerospace microgravity.",html/json-ld,10.1371/journal.pone.0265108,

923,Conducting Plant Experiments in Space and on the Moon,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34647256/,1/1/2022,2022,"The growth and development of plants during spaceflight have important implications for both basic and applied research supported by NASA and other international space agencies. While there have been many reviews of plant space biology, this chapter attempts to fill a gap in the literature on the actual process and methods of performing plant research in the spaceflight environment. One of the authors (JZK) has been a principal investigator on eight spaceflight projects. These experiences include using the U.S. Space Shuttle, the former Russian Space Station Mir, and the International Space Station, utilizing the Space Shuttle and Space X as launch vehicles. While there are several ways to fly an experiment into space and to obtain a spaceflight opportunity, this review focuses on using the NASA peer-reviewed sciences approach to get an experiment manifested for flight. Three narratives for the implementation of plant space biology experiments are considered from rapid turn around of a few months to a project with new hardware development that lasted 6 years. The many challenges of spaceflight research include logistical and resource constraints such as crew time, power, cold stowage, data downlinks, among others. Additional issues considered are working at NASA centers, hardware development, safety concerns, and the engineering versus science culture in space agencies. The difficulties of publishing the results from spaceflight research based on such factors as the lack of controls, limited sample size, and the indirect effects of the spaceflight environment also are summarized. Lessons learned from these spaceflight experiences are discussed in the context of improvements for future space-based research projects with plants. We also will consider new opportunities for Moon-based research via NASA's Artemis lunar exploration program.",html/json-ld,10.1007/978-1-0716-1677-2_12,

This study explored the effects of being a career National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) astronaut on the risk for clinical CVD end points. Methods and Results During the Longitudinal Study of Astronaut Health, data were collected on 310 NASA astronauts and 981 nonastronaut NASA employees. The nonastronauts were matched to the astronauts on age, sex, and body mass index, to evaluate acute and chronic morbidity and mortality. The primary outcomes were composites of clinical CVD end points (myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, stroke, and coronary artery bypass surgery) or coronary artery disease ( CAD ) end points (myocardial infarction and coronary artery bypass surgery). Of the astronauts, 5.2% had a clinical CVD end point and 2.9% had a CAD end point compared with the nonastronaut comparisons with 4.7% and 3.1% having CVD and CAD end points, respectively. In the multivariate models adjusted for traditional risk factors, astronauts had a similar risk of CVD compared with nonastronauts (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.08; 95% CI , 0.60–1.93; P =0.80). Risk of a CAD end point was similar between groups (hazard ratio, 0.97; CI , 0.45–2.08; P =0.93). In astronauts with early spaceflight experience, the risk of CVD (hazard ratio, 0.80; CI , 0.25–2.56; P =0.71) and CAD (hazard ratio, 1.23; CI : 0.27–5.61; P =0.79) compared with astronauts with no experience were not different. Conclusions These findings suggest that being an astronaut is not associated with increased long‐term risk of CVD development.",crossref,10.1161/JAHA.117.005564,

927,ARCH 2001 - A Space Odyssey - The Architecture of Microgravity Environments,https://repository.library.carleton.ca/concern/etds/vx021g30s?locale=en,1/1/2024,2024,"Space Architecture represents a new frontier for architectural thought, theory, and practice. As increasing emphasis is placed on the space exploration, the discipline of architecture must expand to include the design of humane and sustainable habitation in realms where gravity, logistics, and environmental factors operate differently. In addition to their use for telecommunications and military purposes, spacecraft and microgravity environments have a vital role to play in medical research and in the study of climate change. This thesis aspires to be a primer for students of architecture in the design of orbital environments, covering a range of topics beginning with a brief history of space exploration. Embracing design as a form of research, the thesis includes the design of cancer and climate research lab modules within a space station concept in low-Earth-orbit (LEO) as a case study to better understand the range of challenges that architects face in this milieu.",html/json-ld,10.22215/etd/2024-16005,

929,Select Pathways Revealed in A. Thaliana During Spaceflight Via Meta-Analysis of National Aeronautics and Space Administration Genelab Data,https://digitalcommons.latech.edu/theses/104/,,,"In this study, a combination analysis using the pathview and pathfindR packages for the R programming language was performed on a collection of openly available Arabidopsis thaliana sequencing data from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) GeneLab to discover broad connections between three primary spaceflight stressor types and altered pathway regulation to provide focused targets for future research. Studies were divided into groups based on their exposure to microgravity, cosmic radiation, or a theorized heat-stress factor caused by reduced convection in certain technologies. Through this study, three major pathways were identified: the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, proteasome, and starch and sucrose metabolism pathways. In addition, the ribosome and photosynthesis pathways were found to be upregulated in some datasets yet downregulated in others, while the endocytosis and ribosome biogenesis pathways were found to be upregulated and downregulated respectively. This study identifies these pathways and discusses possible reasons for their altered regulation, proposes future directions for study, and addresses open data quality and curation.",,,

934,The role of osteocytes in mechanical unloading and age-induced osteopenia,https://open.bu.edu/handle/2144/45700,1/1/2022,2022,"Bone is a metabolically active tissue that is continuously remodeled throughout life. Osteocytes, the most abundant cells in bone, regulate bone homeostasis in response to hormonal and mechanical cues. Parathyroid hormone (PTH), a calciotropic hormone secreted from the parathyroid glands, has been widely used in the clinic to treat age-related osteoporosis. PTH acts on cells of the osteoblast lineage, including osteocytes, by signaling via the PTH receptor (PPR) to promote bone formation. However, the role of PPR signaling in osteocytes during aging has not been investigated. The hypothesis of this study is that PPR signaling in osteocytes plays a key role in maintaining skeletal health in aging mice. To address this hypothesis, mice in which the PPR was ablated in mature osteoblasts/osteocytes (Dmp1-Cre+;PPRfl/fl or Dmp1-PPRKO) were used to study their skeletal phenotype at 4 and 13 months of age. Compared to control littermates (Dmp1-Cre–;PPRfl/fl), Dmp1-PPRKO animals displayed age-dependent osteopenia due to reduced osteoblast activity and increased osteoclast numbers and activity. These changes were associated with a significant decrease in osteoprogenitors and an increase in marrow adiposity. At the molecular level, the absence of PPR signaling in mature osteoblasts/osteocytes was accompanied by a marked increase in serum sclerostin, RANKL-expressing marrow adipocytes, and early onset of oxidative stress in osteocytes. In vitro studies demonstrated that PTH protected osteocytes from oxidative stress-induced cell death by suppressing the intracellular accumulation of reactive oxygen species. Mechanical forces are also important regulators of bone mass and quality. For instance, immobilization and reduced mechanical loading, such as prolonged bed rest or long-duration spaceflight, lead to bone loss or osteopenia due to reduced bone formation and increased bone resorption. Osteocytes are known to sense and transduce mechanical forces applied to the skeleton into biochemical signals. However, the exact molecular mechanism remains unclear. To unravel the mechanism by which osteocytes sense and respond to mechanical unloading, an osteocytic cell line, Ocy454, was exposed to microgravity (µG) conditions for 2, 4, or 6 days onboard the SpaceX Dragon-6 and the International Space Station. Global transcriptomic analysis demonstrated that µG leads to downregulation of key osteocytic marker genes compared to ground controls (1G), suggesting the impaired differentiation of osteocytes. Importantly, glycolysis was the most activated signaling pathway in osteocytes subjected to µG compared to 1G. Gene comparison analysis further identified a set of mechano-sensitive genes that are consistently regulated in multiple types of cells exposed to µG, suggesting a common, yet to be fully elucidated, genome-wide response to µG. In summary, these studies demonstrated that osteocytes are highly regulated by PTH and mechanical forces. We found that PPR signaling in osteocytes is important for protecting the skeleton from age-induced osteopenia by promoting osteoblast’s bone-forming activity and mitigating osteoclast’s bone resorption. We also demonstrated that PTH protects osteocytes from oxidative stress. Finally, we showed that osteocytes respond to µG with an increase in glucose metabolism and oxygen consumption.",html/json-ld,,
